<p>Computers are just so <em>useful</em> in all domains of human endeavour, and giving
people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. I
really enjoy it, too :)</p>

<p>I’m currently teaching two courses in the
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/">ANU Research School of Computer Science</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in <strong>Semester 1 (Feb-Jun)</strong> I teach <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/"><em>COMP2300: Computer Organisation and
Program Execution</em></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in <strong>Semester 2 (Jul-Nov)</strong> I teach <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/"><em>COMP1720: Art &amp; Interaction in New
Media</em></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or both!) of
these courses—I think they’re pretty great :)</p>

<p>I also give regular guest lectures &amp; run workshops on various topics in my areas
of expertise. If you’re interested in hiring me as a
speaker, <a href="mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au">get in touch</a>.</p>
