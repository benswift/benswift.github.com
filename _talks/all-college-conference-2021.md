We acknowledge and celebrate the First Australians on whose traditional lands we
meet, and pay our respect to the elders past, present and emerging

<https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/creative-computing/>

an [ANU Extension](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) program to
teach computer science to year 11 & 12 students through making art, music and
other cool things with computers

first student intake this year (applications close Feb 14), first graduates in
2022

## today's workshop task

**make a lesson plan for exploring a computing concept through creative code**

- using a browser-based creative computing environment

- you get to choose the concept (e.g. BSSS IT Framework, Australian Curriculum,
  ACM CBoK)

- not enough time to make a detailed lesson plan (obvs) but we'll do our best

- working in groups, hands on---laptops out!

## timeline

| **11:00** | intro & group formation |
| **11:15** | lesson design task      |
| **12:10** | presentations & wrap-up |
| **12:30** | lunch                   |

## creative computing environments

there are lots, but let's focus on these two:

- **p5.js**: <https://p5js.org/> for visuals (using the [web
  editor](https://editor.p5js.org))
- **gibber**: <https://gibber.cc> for sound/music

you're all experienced IT educators, so you can navigate the getting started
guides, examples, etc.

## what's the deliverable?

a 2min presentation/demo of your lesson to the rest of this workshop

for scoping, ask yourself: 

> what are the _minimal_ notes I'd give to a teacher (that I _like_) five
> minutes before having to deliver this lesson to a College IT class?

## reflection questions

1. what's the computing concept you want students to explore, why did you choose
   it, and how did the "creative" aspect impact that decision?

2. if I were to assess what the students made, what would the rubric look like?

3. what scaffolding is required to do this in a College IT context?

(remember, presentations start at 12:10pm)

**presentation time**

## wrap up

thanks so much for participating

I'm keen to:

- make contacts
- get the word out about CC ANUEXT
- be part of a CoP around creative computing for both students and educators

## Bio

Ben is a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the School of
Computing at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). He's interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. He's
the director of the [code/creativity/culture
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) within the ANU School of
Computing.

## Bio

He is a [livecoder]({% link livecoding.md %}), and is the vice president of the
[Australasian Computer Music Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA).
Ben is one of the inaugural [ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.
