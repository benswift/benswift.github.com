## Abstract

The arts (music and visual) have always provided a less-travelled but
fascinating alternate route into computing. As CS Schools around the world
grapple with how best to teach computing to the next generation(s), is computer
music/visual art part of the solution? If so, how can we do it without
introducing _more_ baggage to a curriculum which already throws plenty of other
"hidden prerequisite" hurdles in front of newcomers? In posing (and probably not
answering!) these questions Ben will reflect on 10 years of art+code as both an
educator and creative practitioner, and describe the c/c/c studio: his current
"Reimagine Fellowship" project to bring creative coding into Australian schools.

## Bio

Ben is a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the Research School
of Computer Science at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). He's interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. He's
the director of the [code/creativity/culture
group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) within the ANU Research
School of Computer Science.

He is a [livecoder]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.md %}), and is the vice
president of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA). Ben is one of the inaugural
[ANU Reimagine Fellows]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.

## outline

- 10 years, two parallel journeys to from the arts to CS

- the c/c/c studio and the reimagine project

- open questions
  - how do we make the cultural artefact part of the incentive scheme
  - what's the tension between running a CS education program and an art studio? can it thrive, or just survive?

## so many qualifications!

10¬π years of teaching artists¬≤ to code¬≥ and coders‚Å¥ to art‚Åµ

1. _10 years_: well, 9 actually (since 2011)
2. _artists_: 
3. _code_: yeah, I know, CSEd is more than just coding
4. _coders_: see "artists"
5. _art_: to create something of aesthetic/poetic/ethical value

## central thesis

making music & art is the

## what's next?

these questions keep me up at night
