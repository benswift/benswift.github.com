enough about me... tell me about **you**

musicians

mathematicians

coders

no judgement!

**discuss**: is there a connection?

## outline

- what is music?
- festival of obedience ðŸ¤”
- livecoding

**discuss**: what would a song performed by a computer program sound like?

what are computer programs good at?

## what is (pop) music?

pop songs are characterised by:

- catchy hooks
- repetitive harmonic patterns (e.g. chord progressions)
- processed/synthetic sounds (lots of computers involved in the production)

# livecoding

## what _I'm_ gonna do

- learn a new song (by ear!)
- figure out how to turn it into code
- find a bunch of sounds which sound (approximately) like the recording
- lay down a vocal track (maybe)
- make the whole process make sense to you guys

## what _you're_ gonna do

- help me choose the song
- be kind when I make mistakes
- clap politely at the end (even if I flame out)

**music** _(n.)_

a series of pitched "events" over time

TODO maybe change this next one to a smug liberal? a bit more woke.

## "dimensions" of a musical note

- time
- pitch
- loudness

## parameterisation

- **time** (in beats), e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **pitch** (in MIDI note numbers), e.g. middle C as 60, C# as 61, etc.
- **loudness** (0 is silent, 127 is super loud)

## [extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/): a livecoding _language_

[extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language designed
for musical livecoding (written [Andrew Sorensen](https://twitter.com/digego)
and [me]({{site.baseurl}}{% link index.md %}))

don't worry about the syntax, I'll explain enough for you to follow along

# wrapping up

## what did we learn?

pop music isn't black magic, it's a domain with lots of structure/patterns

computers/code are _really useful_ for modelling/exploring this stuff

this is _not_ AI, either
