We acknowledge and celebrate the First Australians on whose traditional lands we
meet, and pay our respect to the elders past, present and emerging

## welcome

<!-- TODO get a photo of CDCL attendees -->

The code/creativity/culture group (c/c/c) is a research group within the
Research School of Computer Science. Our goal is to create spaces for _talking_,
_thinking_ and _making_ about the way that **code** (software), **creativity**
(especially the arts) and **culture** (life) intersect in the modern world.

TODO and making things?

## the c/c/c studio

an [ANU Extension](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) program to
teach computer science to year 11 & 12 students through making art, music and
other cool things with computers

curriculum being developed right now (using
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) & [COMP2710 Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/) as a starting
point, but everything's up for grabs!)

first student intake (year 11 only) in 2021, first graduates in 2022

## today's workshop task

_Your design brief for today_: in your group, create an assessment task which
teaches a particular **code** concept/tool by exploring a problem/challenge
facing our **culture** through a particular **creative** process/medium.

it might be used in the c/c/c studio ðŸ˜Š
