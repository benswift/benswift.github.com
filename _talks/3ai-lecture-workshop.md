summary: >-
  Cyberphysical systems sure are important. But what counts?

  An interactive presentation/workshop given to the [3a Institute](https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au) masters program.

<!-- ok, here's the plan. -->

## outline

## part un: livecoding example (perhaps break something, e.g. too loud)

## part deux: what makes a CPS

## part trois

what does livecoding show us about agency, autonomy, assurance

autonomy

agency

~~potatoes~~

assurance

## autonomy

> How do we design for an autonomous world?
>
> This is both a technical set of questions and a philosophical and public
> policy set of questions. Just because we can automate something, should we?
> When we translate human processes into machine processes, what do we need to
> consider?

## agency

> How much agency do we give technology?
>
> As the ability for machines to act independently of human oversight increases
> with each new tech breakthrough, conversations need to be had about how much
> agency we give to intelligent cyber-physical systems. Are we comfortable with
> machines responding to their environment, and interacting with other machines,
> without a human to check and validate decisions?

## assurance

> How do we preserve our safety and values?
>
> Current technological progress calls for new regulatory tools and processes,
> as algorithms designed in different places are introduced into societies
> around the world. The virtual nature of these new goods and services has an
> impact on our ability to regulate their design and use in a way that aligns
> with core cultural values.

{% include slides/impact.html %}

but there are some "I"s as well

## indicators

> How do we measure performance and success?
>
> Technical systems have typically been measured on their efficiency. However,
> when systems start to learn and change their behaviour over time, the objective
> of efficiency may begin to clash with ideals that have previously been
> implicitly or tacitly inserted into the process by the humans in the loop. How
> do we start to conceptualise building for sustainability, for beauty, for
> values?

## interfaces 

> How will technologies, systems and humans work together?
>
> In previous decades, we interfaced with computational systems through a screen
> and a keyboard. This paradigm is already being disrupted as ‘smart’ objects
> enter our lives. What will it mean when AI-enabled systems are all around us,
> sensing and responding to us? How to do protect our privacy? What happens to
> all that data?

## intent

> Why has the system been constructed? by whom? and for what purposes?
>
> It is sometimes tempting to think of a single, monolithic AI. However, AIs
> will be built for different purposes and with very different intentionality,
> and inside different larger systems. Making sense of, and mapping, that
> broader intentionality is central to the emergent new applied science.
