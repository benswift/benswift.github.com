summary: >-
  Sure, computers are useful for solving problems, but what about when
  creativity is required? How do we solve problems like producing a pop song
  using code?

## outline

- [what's a producer?](#pop-production)
- [modelling the domain](#modelling-the-domain)
- [programming as problem solving](#production-as-problem-solving)

## what *I'm* gonna do

- learn a new song (by ear!)
- figure out how to turn it into code
- find a bunch of sounds which sound (approximately) like the recording
- lay down a vocal track (maybe)
- make the whole process make sense to you guys

all in 45 minutes

**yikes**

## what *you're* gonna do

- help me choose the song
- be kind when I make mistakes
- clap politely at the end (even if I flame out)

# Pop production {#pop-production}

## what's a producer?

A
[producer](https://www.recordingconnection.com/reference-library/recording-entrepreneurs/what-does-a-music-producer-do/)
is someone who makes songs happen

Pop songs are characterised by:
- catchy hooks
- repetitive harmonic patterns (e.g. chord progressions)
- processed/synthetic sounds (lots of computers involved in the production)

here's the [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcnymzs18LWrKzHmzrGH1JzLBqrHi3xQ)

**music** *(n.)*

a series of pitched "events" over time

## Dimensions of the domain

- time
- pitch
- loudness

## Parameterisation

- **time** (in beats), e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **pitch** (in MIDI note numbers), e.g. middle C as 60, C# as 61, etc.
- **loudness** (same scale as pitch---0 is silent, 127 is super loud)

## Extempore: a livecoding language

[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language designed
for musical livecoding (written Andrew Sorensen and I)

Don't worry about the syntax, I'll explain enough for you to follow along
