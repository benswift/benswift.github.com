## poll

in one(ish) word:

1. what part of your course is the **most beneficial** for your students'
   learning?

2. what part of your course is the **least beneficial** for your students'
   learning?

can be either an activity (e.g. lectures, labs) or part thereof (e.g. assignment
feedback, group work, live coding) or a particular tool/technique (e.g. Wattle
quizzes) but must be something _you have control of_ as convenor

## workshop goals

to develop a shared understanding of what a good learning experience looks like

to have honest, safe discussions about what's working and what's not in our courses

to identify local networks for sharing ideas & resources to improve the student
learning outcomes in our courses

## table discussion

what does a bad learning experience look like?

when you teach, what gets in the way?

## quality learning experiences at scale

teaching at RSCS 2020+: how can we make things (even) better?

no answers, but some helpful questions

## discussion: time & energy

_(a lesson from physics)_
 
in your teaching, what _actually_ consumes your time and energy

what's the relationship between time & energy **in**put and learning **out**comes?

any tips for maximising this efficiency?

## fixed vs marginal costs per student

_(a lesson from economics)_

in your teaching, what are the fixed costs? what are the marginal ones?

as classes get bigger, any tips for exchanging marginal costs for fixed ones?

## an aside: the CECS T&L tech stack

**GitLab** for assignment submission, marking, feedback (ask Ben about the **lucy**
project)

**Jekyll** for delivering course content (website, lab material, lecture slides)

**Discourse** for class discussions

_note: these are all "official" and administered by our tech team_

## know your teammates

_(a lesson from football)_

who has the same challenges as you? who's already overcome them?

who can your

## a commitment

write down one concrete change you'll make* to your
next course to improve the learning outcomes for your students

*_or at least investigate_
