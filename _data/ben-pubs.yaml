  abstract: >-
    Improvisational group music-making, informally known as ‘jamming’, has its
    own cultures and conventions of musical interaction. One characteristic of
    this interaction is the primacy of the experience over the musical
    artefact—in some sense the sound created is not as important as the feeling
    of being ‘in the groove’. As computing devices infiltrate creative,
    open-ended task domains, what can Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) learn
    from jamming? How do we design systems where the goal is not an artefact but
    a felt experience? This chapter examines these issues in light of an
    experiment involving ‘Viscotheque’, a novel group music-making environment
    based on the iPhone.

    User interfaces for source code editing are a crucial component in any
    software development environment, and in many editors visual annotations
    (overlaid on the textual source code) are used to provide important
    contextual information to the programmer. This paper focuses on the
    real-time programming activity of `cyberphysical' programming, and considers
    the type of visual annotations which may be helpful in this programming
    context.

    Social music-making systems offer the possibility of accessible and engaging
    group experiences. In this paper we explore questions concerning the notion
    of 'engagement' in social music-making. In a recent user study of
    Viscotheque, an iPhone-based environment for group musical creativity, three
    different types of engagement were observed: individual, unilateral and
    bilateral. These results indicate that network-based approaches may be
    useful in analysing engagement relationships amongst participants in group
    music-making.

    Percussionists are unique among western classical instrumentalists in that
    their artistic practice is defined by an approach to interaction rather than
    their instruments. While percussionists are accustomed to exploring
    non-traditional objects to create music, these objects have yet to encompass
    touch-screen computing devices to any great extent. The proliferation and
    popularity of these devices now presents an opportunity to explore their use
    in combining computer-generated sound together with percussive interaction
    in a musical ensemble. This paper examines Ensemble Metatone, a group formed
    to explore the "infiltration" of iPad-based musical instruments into a
    free-improvisation percussion ensemble. We discuss the design approach for
    two different iPad percussion instruments and the methodology for exploring
    them with the group over a series of rehearsals and performances.
    Qualitative analysis of discussions throughout this process shows that the
    musicians developed a vocabulary of gestures and musical interactions to
    make musical sense of these new instruments.

    The ten-year anniversary of TOPLAP presents a unique opportunity for
    reflection and introspection. In this essay we ask the question, what is the
    meaning of live coding? Our goal is not to answer this question, in absolute
    terms, but rather to attempt to unpack some of live coding's many meanings.
    Our hope is that by exploring some of the formal, embodied, and cultural
    meanings surrounding live-coding practice, we may help to stimulate a
    conversation that will resonate within the live-coding community for the
    next ten years.

    Livecoding is an artistic programming practice in which an artist's
    low-level interaction can be observed with sufficiently high fidelity to
    allow for transcription and analysis. This paper presents the first reported
    "coding" of livecoding videos. From an identified corpus of videos available
    on the web, we coded performances of two different livecoding artists,
    recording both the (textual) programming edit events and the musical effect
    of these edits. Our analysis includes a novel, transition-matrix
    visualisation of the textual and musical dimensions of this data to create a
    "performer fingerprint". We show how detailed transcriptions of livecoding
    videos can be made which, we hope, will provide a foundation for further
    research into describing and understanding livecoding.

    We present the results of two controlled studies of free-improvised ensemble
    music-making on touch-screens. In our system, updates to an interface of
    harmonically-selected pitches are broadcast to every touch-screen in
    response to either a performer pressing a GUI button, or to interventions
    from an intelligent agent. In our first study, analysis of survey results
    and performance data indicated significant effects of the button on
    performer preference, but of the agent on performance length. In the second
    follow-up study, a mixed-initiative interface, where the presence of the
    button was interlaced with agent interventions, was developed to leverage
    both approaches. Comparison of this mixed-initiative interface with the
    always-on button-plus-agent condition of the first study demonstrated
    significant preferences for the former. The different approaches were found
    to shape the creative interactions that take place. Overall, this research
    offers evidence that an intelligent agent and a networked GUI both improve
    aspects of improvised ensemble music-making.

    The concepts of affect and assemblage proposed by thinkers such as Gilles
    Deleuze and Brian Massumi can help us to understand the interaction between
    users and artefacts in interactive systems, particularly in the context of
    computer-supported improvisation and creativity. In this paper I provide an
    introduction to affect and assemblage theory for HCI practitioners. I then
    use a case study of Viscotheque, an iOS-based interface for group musical
    collaboration, to demonstrate the application of affective analysis in
    making sense of improvisational group music making.

    A recent study of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity associated with
    musical cognition has suggested a correlate for the amount of active musical
    processing taking place in the brains of musicians. Using a version of this
    measure, we have built a new brain computer interface which harnesses the
    "natural" brain activity of musicians to mold and modulate music as it is
    being composed and played. This computer music instrument is part of a
    system, the Mind Attention Interface, which provides an interface to a
    virtual reality theatre using measures of a participant's EEG, eye-gaze and
    head position. The theatre itself, and its spatialised sound system, closes
    a feedback loop through the mind of the participant.

    Knowledge of the collagen structure of an Achilles tendon is critical to
    comprehend the physiology, biomechanics, homeostasis and remodelling of the
    tissue. Despite intensive studies, there are still uncertainties regarding
    the microstructure. The majority of studies have examined the longitudinally
    arranged collagen fibrils as they are primarily attributed to the principal
    tensile strength of the tendon. Few studies have considered the structural
    integrity of the entire three-dimensional (3D) collagen meshwork, and how
    the longitudinal collagen fibrils are integrated as a strong unit in a 3D
    domain to provide the tendons with the essential tensile properties. Using
    second harmonic generation imaging, a 3D imaging technique was developed and
    used to study the 3D collagen matrix in the midportion of Achilles tendons
    without tissue labelling and dehydration. Therefore, the 3D collagen
    structure is presented in a condition closely representative of the in vivo
    status. Atomic force microscopy studies have confirmed that second harmonic
    generation reveals the internal collagen matrix of tendons in 3D at a fibril
    level. Achilles tendons primarily contain longitudinal collagen fibrils that
    braid spatially into a dense rope-like collagen meshwork and are
    encapsulated or wound tightly by the oblique collagen fibrils emanating from
    the epitenon region. The arrangement of the collagen fibrils provides the
    longitudinal fibrils with essential structural integrity and endows the
    tendon with the unique mechanical function for withstanding tensile
    stresses. A novel 3D microscopic method has been developed to examine the 3D
    collagen microstructure of tendons without tissue dehydrating and labelling.
    The study also provides new knowledge about the collagen microstructure in
    an Achilles tendon, which enables understanding of the function of the
    tissue. The knowledge may be important for applying surgical and tissue
    engineering techniques to tendon reconstruction.

    incorporated into a traditional, “offline”, development workflow. We discuss
    how live programming tools and techniques can be productively integrated

    Artificial neural networks have proved successful in a broad range of
    applications over the last decade. However, there remain significant
    concerns about their interpretability. Visual representation is one way
    researchers are attempting to make sense of these models and their
    behaviour. The representation of neural networks raises questions which
    cross disciplinary boundaries. This chapter draws on a growing collection of
    interdisciplinary scholarship regarding neural networks. We present six case
    studies in the visual representation of neural networks and examine the
    particular representational challenges posed by these algorithms. Finally we
    summarise the ideas raised in the case studies as a set of takeaways for
    researchers engaging in this area.

    Our cultural and scientific understandings of neural networks are built on a
    set of philosophical ideas which might turn out to be superstitions. Drawing
    on methodologies of defamiliarisation and performance art which have been
    adopted by HCI, we present an analog apparatus for the ritualistic
    performance of neural network algorithms. The apparatus draws on the
    interaction modes of the Ouija board to provide a system which involves the
    user in the computation. By recontextualising neural computation, the work
    creates critical distance with which to examine the philosophical and
    cultural assumptions embedded in our conception of AI.

    This paper describes an empirical study of source code visualisation as a
    means to communicate the programming process in "live coding" computer music
    performances. Following an exploratory field study of a live-coding
    performance at an arts festival, two different interaction-driven
    visualisation techniques were incorporated into a live coding system. We
    then performed a more controlled laboratory study to evaluate the
    visualisations' contributions to the audience experience, with emphasis on
    the (self-reported) experiential dimensions of understanding and enjoyment.
    Both software visualisation techniques enhanced audience enjoyment, while
    the effect on audience understanding was more complex. We conclude by
    suggesting how these visualisation techniques may be used to enhance the
    audience experience of live coding.

    Network connectivity offers the potential for a group of musicians to play
    together over the network. This paper describes a trans-Atlantic networked
    musical livecoding performance between Andrew Sorensen in Germany (at the
    Schloss Daghstuhl conference on Collaboration and Learning through Live
    Coding) and Ben Swift in San Jose (at YL/HCC) in September 2013. In this
    paper we describe the infrastructure developed to enable this performance.

    This paper seeks to bridge that gap by creating, analyzing and publishing a
    case study example - the Chinese classic 'Shanhaijing' (Classic of Mountains
    and Seas, 山海经) - using Linked Data methods. We recount the complexities of
    representing ancient Chinese literary narratives, captured through a close
    reading of the narrative (unstructured) data in both English and Classical
    Chinese. We evaluate the challenges in using tools developed from Western
    perspectives and for complete and largely homogeneous, highly-structured
    data for the capture of the characteristics and related information about
    the monsters and mythical creatures described within the 'Shanhaijing'. We
    present a purpose-built user-interface, which allows users to explore this
    data both with and without needing to write SPARQL queries.

  abstract: >-
    Open-ended human-computer interactions, such as those in interactive digital
    art and music, are an increasingly popular area of study in HCI. They
    provide an opportunity to examine playfulness, creativity and expression and
    challenge conventional HCI notions of quality, evaluation and how to measure
    success.  Jamming-improvisational group music making-is often held up as an
    example of open-ended creativity. This thesis describes the development of
    Viscotheque, an iPhone- based digital musical instrument (DMI) designed for
    jamming, over three major design-test cycles. Over these three iterations
    the interface evolved from a very simple 'process control'  interface in v1
    to a more expressive multi-touch sample manipulation tool in v3. At each
    stage of the design process, open-ended jam sessions held with local
    musicians suggested that the potential was there for the interface to
    support rich jamming experiences. Version 3 of the interface and the
    associated v3 jam session was the most in-depth of the three phases of the
    experiment, with the most expressive interface and also the most
    comprehensive field trial (using a multi-session longitudinal study of
    jamming musicians rather than the single jam sessions of v1 and v2). 
    Situating the qualitative results of these experiments within the broader
    context of third wave HCI, this thesis discusses 'affect' in a guise perhaps
    unfamiliar to readers of mainstream HCI discourse. The jam sessions were
    characterised by intense sonic atmospheres, and the post-jam interviews
    reveal a complicated picture of agency in the interaction of the musician
    and their sound. The thesis also presents a detailed analysis of the
    quantitative log data, including the results of a Machine Learning (ML)
    approach to looking for patterns in this data.  Finally, the thesis
    discusses the implications of the Viscotheque design process for HCI more
    broadly, including the powerful affective atmospheres which characterise
    musical interaction and an approach to data analysis which leverages the
    mathematical sophistication of modern ML techniques while remaining
    sensitive to the difficulties surrounding the measurement of experience. --
