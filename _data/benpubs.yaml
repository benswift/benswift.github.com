  abstract: >-
    Improvisational group music-making, informally known as ‘jamming’, has its
    own cultures and conventions of musical interaction. One characteristic of
    this interaction is the primacy of the experience over the musical
    artefact—in some sense the sound created is not as important as the feeling
    of being ‘in the groove’. As computing devices infiltrate creative,
    open-ended task domains, what can Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) learn
    from jamming? How do we design systems where the goal is not an artefact but
    a felt experience? This chapter examines these issues in light of an
    experiment involving ‘Viscotheque’, a novel group music-making environment
    based on the iPhone.

    User interfaces for source code editing are a crucial component in any
    software development environment, and in many editors visual annotations
    (overlaid on the textual source code) are used to provide important
    contextual information to the programmer. This paper focuses on the
    real-time programming activity of `cyberphysical' programming, and considers
    the type of visual annotations which may be helpful in this programming
    context.

    Social music-making systems offer the possibility of accessible and engaging
    group experiences. In this paper we explore questions concerning the notion
    of 'engagement' in social music-making. In a recent user study of
    Viscotheque, an iPhone-based environment for group musical creativity, three
    different types of engagement were observed: individual, unilateral and
    bilateral. These results indicate that network-based approaches may be
    useful in analysing engagement relationships amongst participants in group
    music-making.

    Percussionists are unique among western classical instrumentalists in that
    their artistic practice is defined by an approach to interaction rather than
    their instruments. While percussionists are accustomed to exploring
    non-traditional objects to create music, these objects have yet to encompass
    touch-screen computing devices to any great extent. The proliferation and
    popularity of these devices now presents an opportunity to explore their use
    in combining computer-generated sound together with percussive interaction
    in a musical ensemble. This paper examines Ensemble Metatone, a group formed
    to explore the "infiltration" of iPad-based musical instruments into a
    free-improvisation percussion ensemble. We discuss the design approach for
    two different iPad percussion instruments and the methodology for exploring
    them with the group over a series of rehearsals and performances.
    Qualitative analysis of discussions throughout this process shows that the
    musicians developed a vocabulary of gestures and musical interactions to
    make musical sense of these new instruments.

    The ten-year anniversary of TOPLAP presents a unique opportunity for
    reflection and introspection. In this essay we ask the question, what is the
    meaning of live coding? Our goal is not to answer this question, in absolute
    terms, but rather to attempt to unpack some of live coding's many meanings.
    Our hope is that by exploring some of the formal, embodied, and cultural
    meanings surrounding live-coding practice, we may help to stimulate a
    conversation that will resonate within the live-coding community for the
    next ten years.

    Livecoding is an artistic programming practice in which an artist's
    low-level interaction can be observed with sufficiently high fidelity to
    allow for transcription and analysis. This paper presents the first reported
    "coding" of livecoding videos. From an identified corpus of videos available
    on the web, we coded performances of two different livecoding artists,
    recording both the (textual) programming edit events and the musical effect
    of these edits. Our analysis includes a novel, transition-matrix
    visualisation of the textual and musical dimensions of this data to create a
    "performer fingerprint". We show how detailed transcriptions of livecoding
    videos can be made which, we hope, will provide a foundation for further
    research into describing and understanding livecoding.

    We present the results of two controlled studies of free-improvised ensemble
    music-making on touch-screens. In our system, updates to an interface of
    harmonically-selected pitches are broadcast to every touch-screen in
    response to either a performer pressing a GUI button, or to interventions
    from an intelligent agent. In our first study, analysis of survey results
    and performance data indicated significant effects of the button on
    performer preference, but of the agent on performance length. In the second
    follow-up study, a mixed-initiative interface, where the presence of the
    button was interlaced with agent interventions, was developed to leverage
    both approaches. Comparison of this mixed-initiative interface with the
    always-on button-plus-agent condition of the first study demonstrated
    significant preferences for the former. The different approaches were found
    to shape the creative interactions that take place. Overall, this research
    offers evidence that an intelligent agent and a networked GUI both improve
    aspects of improvised ensemble music-making.

    The concepts of affect and assemblage proposed by thinkers such as Gilles
    Deleuze and Brian Massumi can help us to understand the interaction between
    users and artefacts in interactive systems, particularly in the context of
    computer-supported improvisation and creativity. In this paper I provide an
    introduction to affect and assemblage theory for HCI practitioners. I then
    use a case study of Viscotheque, an iOS-based interface for group musical
    collaboration, to demonstrate the application of affective analysis in
    making sense of improvisational group music making.

    A recent study of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity associated with
    musical cognition has suggested a correlate for the amount of active musical
    processing taking place in the brains of musicians. Using a version of this
    measure, we have built a new brain computer interface which harnesses the
    "natural" brain activity of musicians to mold and modulate music as it is
    being composed and played. This computer music instrument is part of a
    system, the Mind Attention Interface, which provides an interface to a
    virtual reality theatre using measures of a participant's EEG, eye-gaze and
    head position. The theatre itself, and its spatialised sound system, closes
    a feedback loop through the mind of the participant.

    Knowledge of the collagen structure of an Achilles tendon is critical to
    comprehend the physiology, biomechanics, homeostasis and remodelling of the
    tissue. Despite intensive studies, there are still uncertainties regarding
    the microstructure. The majority of studies have examined the longitudinally
    arranged collagen fibrils as they are primarily attributed to the principal
    tensile strength of the tendon. Few studies have considered the structural
    integrity of the entire three-dimensional (3D) collagen meshwork, and how
    the longitudinal collagen fibrils are integrated as a strong unit in a 3D
    domain to provide the tendons with the essential tensile properties. Using
    second harmonic generation imaging, a 3D imaging technique was developed and
    used to study the 3D collagen matrix in the midportion of Achilles tendons
    without tissue labelling and dehydration. Therefore, the 3D collagen
    structure is presented in a condition closely representative of the in vivo
    status. Atomic force microscopy studies have confirmed that second harmonic
    generation reveals the internal collagen matrix of tendons in 3D at a fibril
    level. Achilles tendons primarily contain longitudinal collagen fibrils that
    braid spatially into a dense rope-like collagen meshwork and are
    encapsulated or wound tightly by the oblique collagen fibrils emanating from
    the epitenon region. The arrangement of the collagen fibrils provides the
    longitudinal fibrils with essential structural integrity and endows the
    tendon with the unique mechanical function for withstanding tensile
    stresses. A novel 3D microscopic method has been developed to examine the 3D
    collagen microstructure of tendons without tissue dehydrating and labelling.
    The study also provides new knowledge about the collagen microstructure in
    an Achilles tendon, which enables understanding of the function of the
    tissue. The knowledge may be important for applying surgical and tissue
    engineering techniques to tendon reconstruction.

    incorporated into a traditional, “offline”, development workflow. We discuss
    how live programming tools and techniques can be productively integrated

    Artificial neural networks have proved successful in a broad range of
    applications over the last decade. However, there remain significant
    concerns about their interpretability. Visual representation is one way
    researchers are attempting to make sense of these models and their
    behaviour. The representation of neural networks raises questions which
    cross disciplinary boundaries. This chapter draws on a growing collection of
    interdisciplinary scholarship regarding neural networks. We present six case
    studies in the visual representation of neural networks and examine the
    particular representational challenges posed by these algorithms. Finally we
    summarise the ideas raised in the case studies as a set of takeaways for
    researchers engaging in this area.

    Our cultural and scientific understandings of neural networks are built on a
    set of philosophical ideas which might turn out to be superstitions. Drawing
    on methodologies of defamiliarisation and performance art which have been
    adopted by HCI, we present an analog apparatus for the ritualistic
    performance of neural network algorithms. The apparatus draws on the
    interaction modes of the Ouija board to provide a system which involves the
    user in the computation. By recontextualising neural computation, the work
    creates critical distance with which to examine the philosophical and
    cultural assumptions embedded in our conception of AI.

    This paper describes an empirical study of source code visualisation as a
    means to communicate the programming process in "live coding" computer music
    performances. Following an exploratory field study of a live-coding
    performance at an arts festival, two different interaction-driven
    visualisation techniques were incorporated into a live coding system. We
    then performed a more controlled laboratory study to evaluate the
    visualisations' contributions to the audience experience, with emphasis on
    the (self-reported) experiential dimensions of understanding and enjoyment.
    Both software visualisation techniques enhanced audience enjoyment, while
    the effect on audience understanding was more complex. We conclude by
    suggesting how these visualisation techniques may be used to enhance the
    audience experience of live coding.

    The visualisation of source code has been examined as a method of enhancing
    audience experience within “live coding”. Following an exploratory field
    study examining the experience of the audience observing source code
    projections, two process-driven source code visualisation techniques were
    incorporated into a live coding system. These visualisations were evaluated
    within a user study during a series of live coding performances, examining
    the self-reported experiential dimensions of understanding and enjoyment.
    Through a process of refinement, a follow-up user study was con- ducted on a
    second iteration of the visualisation techniques comparing visualisations
    with no visualisations to determine if the visualisations had enhanced the
    audience’s experience.

    The exploratory field study examined the validity of the dimensions of
    understand- ing and enjoyment for evaluating visualisations within live
    coding and indicated the potential for visualisations to enhance these
    dimensions through the live coding per- formance. Results of the initial
    user study identified the ability to manipulate the dimensions of
    understanding and enjoyment through the beginning, middle and end of the
    live coding performance. Finally, the follow-up user study determined the
    effec- tiveness of the visualisations over no visualisations within live
    coding. Minor increases in both understanding and enjoyment were identified
    for these visualisations, with an identified increase in understanding for
    those initially with lower understanding and an increase to enjoyment
    throughout the middle stages of the live coding performance. Results of the
    three studies are indicative of the potential for visualisations within live
    coding to enhance the experience of the audience.

    The existence of adversarial examples in which an imperceptible change in
    the input can fool well trained neural networks was experimentally
    discovered by Szegedy et al in 2013, who called them "Intriguing properties
    of neural networks". Since then, this topic had become one of the hottest
    research areas within machine learning, but the ease with which we can
    switch between any two decisions in targeted attacks is still far from being
    understood, and in particular it is not clear which parameters determine the
    number of input coordinates we have to change in order to mislead the
    network. In this paper we develop a simple mathematical framework which
    enables us to think about this baffling phenomenon from a fresh perspective,
    turning it into a natural consequence of the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with
    the $L_0$ (Hamming) metric, which can be quantitatively analyzed. In
    particular, we explain why we should expect to find targeted adversarial
    examples with Hamming distance of roughly $m$ in arbitrarily deep neural
    networks which are designed to distinguish between $m$ input classes.

    First and foremost, the philosophy of digital art is the study ofthe nature
    and appreciative grounds of all those kinds of art whoseproduction and
    presentation crucially involves computer processing.This first-order inquiry
    cannot proceed without acknowledgment ofclaims made by media and cultural
    theorists, art theorists and artaudiences, concerning the way digital image-
    and sound-makingtechnologies are fundamentally changing our understanding of
    art,representation, and perceptual experience. These claims suggest thatthe
    “digital condition” induces a loss of trust in theimage, a new way of
    experiencing the world as indeterminate andfragmentary, and a breakdown of
    traditional boundaries between artistand audience, artwork and artistic
    process. Testing these claimsrequires a formal understanding of the
    distinction between analog anddigital systems and the implications of that
    distinction for aestheticappreciation. The philosophy of digital art
    proceeds from a carefullyarticulated general account of digital
    representation to aninvestigation of the precise ways in which different
    kinds of digitalart are digital. This leads to a further investigation into
    the waysan artwork’s digital status bears on its appropriateappreciation. 
    By conducting a systematic analysis of the digital asan artistically
    significant category, the philosophy of digital artseeks to ground
    burgeoning interdisciplinary and popular interest inthe so-called “digital
    revolution”.,  The philosophy of digital art is not yet a
    well-establishedsubfield. At present, work in the field is limited to
    isolatedtreatments of particular digital art forms. Three recent
    monographs,one on video games (Tavinor 2009), one on digital cinema (Gaut
    2010),and one on computer art (Lopes 2010), have been invaluable
    indemonstrating the philosophical richness of questions concerning artand
    computer technology. But there is still a great deal ofphilosophical work to
    be done. Digital art has been part of themainstream art world since the late
    1990s (Paul 2008), and with somuch of it networked, the reach of digital art
    extends far beyond thetraditional gallery. Scholars in other disciplines
    have been quick toclaim digital cinema and photography, videogames and
    virtual reality,as new subjects for theorizing. What is needed from
    philosophers is ageneral conceptual framework for an interdisciplinary
    discussion ofthe true extent to which the digital has revolutionized art
    andmedia.

    The definition of art is controversial in contemporary philosophy.Whether
    art can be defined has also been a matter of controversy.  Thephilosophical
    usefulness of a definition of art has also beendebated.,  Contemporary
    definitions can be classified with respect to thedimensions of art they
    emphasize. One distinctively modern,conventionalist, sort of definition
    focuses on art’sinstitutional features, emphasizing the way art changes over
    time,modern works that appear to break radically with all traditional
    art,the relational properties of artworks that depend on works’relations to
    art history, art genres, etc. – more broadly, onthe undeniable heterogeneity
    of the class of artworks.  The moretraditional, less conventionalist sort of
    definition defended incontemporary philosophy makes use of a broader, more
    traditionalconcept of aesthetic properties that includes more than
    art-relationalones, and puts more emphasis on art’s pan-cultural
    andtrans-historical characteristics – in sum, on commonalitiesacross the
    class of artworks. Hybrid definitions aim to do justice toboth the
    traditional aesthetic dimension as well as to theinstitutional and
    art-historical dimensions of art, while privilegingneither.

    Questions central to the ontology of art include the following: whatsort(s)
    of things are works of art? Do all works of art belong to anyone basic
    ontological category?  Do all or only some works havemultiple instances? Do
    works have (material) parts or constituents,and if so, what is their
    relation to the work as a whole? How areparticular works of art
    individuated? Are they created or discovered?Can they be destroyed?,
    Explicit and extensive treatments of these topics writtenprior to the 19th
    century have yet to be found. This doesnot mean, however, that there is
    nothing relevant to these ontologicalquestions in early writings on beauty,
    the arts, and relatedmatters. For example, Aristotle’s claims about the
    functions andelements of tragedy (see Gerald Else 1957) can be mined for
    ideasabout the nature of literary works more generally. And what can bemade
    of the hint, inMetaphysics Eta, 6, that the unity of The Iliad isa matter of
    a set of words made “one” by being connected together?, Rather than
    attempting to make conjectures about such difficultexegetical topics, this
    entry focuses primarily on contributions madeby authors who explicitly
    address themselves at length to some of theaforementioned questions
    pertaining to the ontology of works of art,either in general or with
    reference to such major art forms as music,literature, painting,
    architecture, and sculpture., One further note about the scope of this entry
    is inorder. Instructive surveys of the subfield of aesthetics known as
    theontology of art are fairly plentiful; see Nicholas Wolterstorff(1992),
    Gregory Currie (1998, 2010), Joseph Margolis (1998), StephenDavies (2003a),
    Amie Thomasson (2004, 2006b), Guy Rohrbaugh (2005),Theodore Gracyk (2009),
    Robert Stecker (2010), and Carl Matheson andBen Caplan (2011). Surveys of
    the history of the field havenot, however, been forthcoming, and the
    comments on this topic thatcrop up in the literature are sketchy and
    sometimes quitemisleading. One shortcoming has been a marked tendency to
    focus oncontributions from the last two decades of the 20thcentury, the one
    salient exception being due attention paid to worksby Roman Ingarden (e.g,
    1931, 1962, and see the entry on Ingarden).The present entry has been
    designed with this shortcoming in mind.  Aschematic mapping of questions and
    positions is provided and referenceis made to neglected, earlier
    contributions to the ontology ofart.

    The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
    convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best
    performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
    mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
    based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and
    convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show
    these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and
    requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on
    the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing
    best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014
    English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model
    state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight
    GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the
    literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by
    applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and
    limited training data.

    At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast
    and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life,
    which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic
    society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key
    impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack
    transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful
    predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a
    new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial
    promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is
    recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress
    without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested
    researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly
    growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature,
    we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends
    surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.

    In this paper, we study counterfactual fairness in text classification,
    which asks the question: How would the prediction change if the sensitive
    attribute referenced in the example were different? Toxicity classifiers
    demonstrate a counterfactual fairness issue by predicting that "Some people
    are gay" is toxic while "Some people are straight" is nontoxic. We offer a
    metric, counterfactual token fairness (CTF), for measuring this particular
    form of fairness in text classifiers, and describe its relationship with
    group fairness. Further, we offer three approaches, blindness,
    counterfactual augmentation, and counterfactual logit pairing (CLP), for
    optimizing counterfactual token fairness during training, bridging the
    robustness and fairness literature. Empirically, we find that blindness and
    CLP address counterfactual token fairness. The methods do not harm
    classifier performance, and have varying tradeoffs with group fairness.
    These approaches, both for measurement and optimization, provide a new path
    forward for addressing fairness concerns in text classification.

    Semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction refers to the problem of
    selecting those input features that are most predictive of a given outcome;
    a problem encountered in many areas such as machine learning, pattern
    recognition, and signal processing. This has found successful application in
    tasks that involve data sets containing huge numbers of features (in the
    order of tens of thousands), which would be impossible to process further.
    Recent examples include text processing and Web content classification. One
    of the many successful applications of rough set theory has been to this
    feature selection area. This paper reviews those techniques that preserve
    the underlying semantics of the data, using crisp and fuzzy rough set-based
    methodologies. Several approaches to feature selection based on rough set
    theory are experimentally compared. Additionally, a new area in feature
    selection, feature grouping, is highlighted and a rough set-based feature
    grouping technique is detailed.

    In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many
    applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine
    learning algorithm makes certain predictions. For example, if an algorithm
    classifies a given pathology image to be a malignant tumor, then the doctor
    may need to know which parts of the image led the algorithm to this
    classification. How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important
    and active area of research. A fundamental question is: how much can we
    trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation
    of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense:
    two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can
    be assigned very different interpretations. We systematically characterize
    the fragility of several widely-used feature-importance interpretation
    methods (saliency maps, relevance propagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and
    CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can
    change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to
    dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend
    these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g.
    influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of
    the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental
    challenge to the current interpretation approaches.

    This paper seeks to bridge that gap by creating, analyzing and publishing a
    case study example - the Chinese classic 'Shanhaijing' (Classic of Mountains
    and Seas, 山海经) - using Linked Data methods. We recount the complexities of
    representing ancient Chinese literary narratives, captured through a close
    reading of the narrative (unstructured) data in both English and Classical
    Chinese. We evaluate the challenges in using tools developed from Western
    perspectives and for complete and largely homogeneous, highly-structured
    data for the capture of the characteristics and related information about
    the monsters and mythical creatures described within the 'Shanhaijing'. We
    present a purpose-built user-interface, which allows users to explore this
    data both with and without needing to write SPARQL queries.

    Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, especially in Machine Learning
    (ML), have brought applications previously considered as science fiction
    (e.g., virtual personal assistants and autonomous cars) into the reach of
    millions of everyday users. Since modern ML technologies like deep learning
    require considerable technical expertise and resource to build custom
    models, reusing existing models trained by experts has become essential.
    This is why in the past year model stores have been introduced, which,
    similar to mobile app stores, offer organizations and developers access to
    pre-trained models and/or their code to train, evaluate, and predict
    samples. This paper conducts an exploratory study on three popular model
    stores (AWS marketplace, Wolfram neural net repository, and ModelDepot) that
    compares the information elements (features and policies) provided by model
    stores to those used by the two popular mobile app stores (Google Play and
    Apple's App Store). We have found that the model information elements vary
    among the different model stores, with 65% elements shared by all three
    studied stores. Model stores share five information elements with mobile app
    stores, while eight elements are unique to model stores and four elements
    unique to app stores. Only few models were available on multiple model
    stores. Our findings allow to better understand the differences between ML
    models and "regular" source code components or applications, and provide
    inspiration to identify software engineering practices (e.g., in
    requirements and delivery) specific to ML applications.

    The laptop ensemble is a platform that has recently been made possible by
    computer technology that enables individuals to perform music
    collaboratively. Research in this area has largely focused on the
    performance aspects, with very few studies focusing on the development of
    musical competency through participation in a laptop ensemble. This article
    reports the findings of a study that assessed the development of
    participants’ (n = 80) perceived musical and non-musical competencies in a
    laptop ensemble affiliated to a tertiary institution in Hong Kong. A mixed
    methods approach consisting of a questionnaire survey and semi-structured
    interviews was used to investigate their learning experiences. For
    comparison, the questionnaire was also administered to participants in a
    conventional acoustic orchestra (n = 80). Semi-structured interviews were
    conducted with the laptop ensemble group to examine the participants’
    perceptions of the development of their musical and non-musical
    competencies. A three-way dependency model was developed based on the
    findings, which revealed the technologically-oriented aspects of musical and
    non-musical competency development in the laptop ensemble. Participating in
    the laptop ensemble fostered students’ ability to develop both musical and
    technological skills, which fits with the framework of digital musicianship
    of essential skills for musicians and music educators in the digital era.

    The Concordia Laptop Orchestra (CLOrk) is an ensemble of 20-25 laptop
    performers, which operates in the framework of a university course in Live
    Digital Practices—an advanced undergraduate course for electroacoustic
    studies (EaSt) majors at Concordia University’s Music Department in
    Montreal. The curriculum is built around highly participatory planning,
    production, and realization of innovative interdisciplinary and networked
    laptop orchestra performances, which take place in professional, academic,
    and cyber settings. In its three years, CLOrk has collaborated with a
    symphonic orchestra, jazz and chamber ensembles, laptop orchestras,
    soloists, dancers, and VJs, among others. The innovativeness of CLOrk’s
    performances has encompassed artistic (new forms of creation, collaborative
    composition), sonic (sound design, space, aural perception), technological
    (tools, network), and social (listening culture, encounter, interaction,
    collaboration, audience) facets. These innovations constantly introduced
    new, and often unique, practical and philosophical challenges to the
    creative process, but also opportunities to apply innovative educational
    approaches. Due to its adaptability to quickly evolving processes, action
    research has served as a useful transformational inquiry method for
    supporting and developing a better understanding of CLOrk’s creative and
    educational evolution. Action research involves participants as
    co-researchers to promote a better understanding of a social process in the
    group most involved in it. It is structured in cycles of observation,
    critical reflection, and action designed to allow improving a process while
    studying it—metaphorically “designing the plane while flying it” [1].

    In this paper, we describe a pilot study of EarSketch, a computational
    remixing approach to introductory computer science, in a formal academic
    computing course at the high school level. The EarSketch project provides an
    integrated curriculum, Python API, digital audio workstation (DAW), audio
    loop library, and social sharing site. The goal for EarSketch is to broaden
    participation in computing, particularly by traditionally underrepresented
    groups, through a thickly authentic learning environment that has personal
    and industry relevance in both computational and artistic domains. The pilot
    results show statistically significant gains in computing attitudes across
    multiple constructs, with particularly strong results for female and
    minority participants.

    We investigate the phenomenon of adversarial collaboration, through field
    studies of a legal firm. Adversarial collaboration requires that people with
    opposing goals (adversaries) come to agreement, usually producing a shared
    product that reflects the interests of the adversarial parties. Adversarial
    collaboration is characterized by secrecy, advocacy and discovery. To
    support this activity, software should provide flexible, selective sharing
    of awareness and access. These requirements contrast with conventional
    shared resource and awareness systems, which tend to assume cooperative
    collaboration, characterized by open processes and static membership lists.
    We illustrate these ideas in a redesign of our PeopleFlow research
    prototype.

    Participatory design (PD) has become increasingly engaged in public spheres
    and everyday life and is no longer solely concerned with the workplace. This
    is not only a shift from work-oriented productive activities to leisure and
    pleasurable engagements, but also a new milieu for production and
    ‘innovation’. What ‘democratic innovation’ entails is often currently
    defined by management and innovation research, which claims that innovation
    has been democratised through easy access to production tools and lead-users
    as the new experts driving innovation. We sketch an alternative ‘innovation’
    practice more in line with the original visions of PD based on our
    experience of running Malmö Living Labs – an open innovation milieu where
    new constellations, issues and ideas evolve from bottom–up long-term
    collaborations among diverse stakeholders. Three cases and controversial
    matters of concern are discussed. The fruitfulness of the concepts
    ‘agonistic public spaces’ (as opposed to consensual decision-making),
    ‘thinging’ and ‘infrastructuring’ (as opposed to projects) are explored in
    relation to democracy, innovation and other future-making practices.

    Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently
    misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but
    intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such
    that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer
    with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused
    on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of
    neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear
    nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while
    giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their
    generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view
    yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using
    this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the
    test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.

    We identify obfuscated gradients, a kind of gradient masking, as a
    phenomenon that leads to a false sense of security in defenses against
    adversarial examples. While defenses that cause obfuscated gradients appear
    to defeat iterative optimization-based attacks, we find defenses relying on
    this effect can be circumvented. We describe characteristic behaviors of
    defenses exhibiting the effect, and for each of the three types of
    obfuscated gradients we discover, we develop attack techniques to overcome
    it. In a case study, examining non-certified white-box-secure defenses at
    ICLR 2018, we find obfuscated gradients are a common occurrence, with 7 of 9
    defenses relying on obfuscated gradients. Our new attacks successfully
    circumvent 6 completely, and 1 partially, in the original threat model each
    paper considers.

    Machine learning classifiers are known to be vulnerable to inputs
    maliciously constructed by adversaries to force misclassification. Such
    adversarial examples have been extensively studied in the context of
    computer vision applications. In this work, we show adversarial attacks are
    also effective when targeting neural network policies in reinforcement
    learning. Specifically, we show existing adversarial example crafting
    techniques can be used to significantly degrade test-time performance of
    trained policies. Our threat model considers adversaries capable of
    introducing small perturbations to the raw input of the policy. We
    characterize the degree of vulnerability across tasks and training
    algorithms, for a subclass of adversarial-example attacks in white-box and
    black-box settings. Regardless of the learned task or training algorithm, we
    observe a significant drop in performance, even with small adversarial
    perturbations that do not interfere with human perception. Videos are
    available at http://rll.berkeley.edu/adversarial.

    Learning-based pattern classifiers, including deep networks, have shown
    impressive performance in several application domains, ranging from computer
    vision to cybersecurity. However, it has also been shown that adversarial
    input perturbations carefully crafted either at training or at test time can
    easily subvert their predictions. The vulnerability of machine learning to
    such wild patterns (also referred to as adversarial examples), along with
    the design of suitable countermeasures, have been investigated in the
    research field of adversarial machine learning. In this work, we provide a
    thorough overview of the evolution of this research area over the last ten
    years and beyond, starting from pioneering, earlier work on the security of
    non-deep learning algorithms up to more recent work aimed to understand the
    security properties of deep learning algorithms, in the context of computer
    vision and cybersecurity tasks. We report interesting connections between
    these apparently-different lines of work, highlighting common misconceptions
    related to the security evaluation of machine-learning algorithms. We review
    the main threat models and attacks defined to this end, and discuss the main
    limitations of current work, along with the corresponding future challenges
    towards the design of more secure learning algorithms.

    Critical design is a research through design methodology that foregrounds
    the ethics of design practice, reveals potentially hidden agendas and
    values, and explores alternative design values. While it seems to be a
    timely fit for today's socially, aesthetically, and ethically oriented
    approaches to HCI, its adoption seems surprisingly limited. We argue that
    its central concepts and methods are unclear and difficult to adopt. Rather
    than merely attempting to decode the intentions of its originators, Dunne
    and Raby, we instead turn to traditions of critical thought in the past 150
    years to explore a range of critical ideas and their practical uses. We then
    suggest ways that these ideas and uses can be leveraged as practical
    resources for HCI researchers interested in critical design. We also offer
    readings of two designs, which are not billed as critical designs, but which
    we argue are critical using a broader formulation of the concept than the
    one found in the current literature.

  abstract: >-
    Open-ended human-computer interactions, such as those in interactive digital
    art and music, are an increasingly popular area of study in HCI. They
    provide an opportunity to examine playfulness, creativity and expression and
    challenge conventional HCI notions of quality, evaluation and how to measure
    success.  Jamming-improvisational group music making-is often held up as an
    example of open-ended creativity. This thesis describes the development of
    Viscotheque, an iPhone- based digital musical instrument (DMI) designed for
    jamming, over three major design-test cycles. Over these three iterations
    the interface evolved from a very simple 'process control'  interface in v1
    to a more expressive multi-touch sample manipulation tool in v3. At each
    stage of the design process, open-ended jam sessions held with local
    musicians suggested that the potential was there for the interface to
    support rich jamming experiences. Version 3 of the interface and the
    associated v3 jam session was the most in-depth of the three phases of the
    experiment, with the most expressive interface and also the most
    comprehensive field trial (using a multi-session longitudinal study of
    jamming musicians rather than the single jam sessions of v1 and v2). 
    Situating the qualitative results of these experiments within the broader
    context of third wave HCI, this thesis discusses 'affect' in a guise perhaps
    unfamiliar to readers of mainstream HCI discourse. The jam sessions were
    characterised by intense sonic atmospheres, and the post-jam interviews
    reveal a complicated picture of agency in the interaction of the musician
    and their sound. The thesis also presents a detailed analysis of the
    quantitative log data, including the results of a Machine Learning (ML)
    approach to looking for patterns in this data.  Finally, the thesis
    discusses the implications of the Viscotheque design process for HCI more
    broadly, including the powerful affective atmospheres which characterise
    musical interaction and an approach to data analysis which leverages the
    mathematical sophistication of modern ML techniques while remaining
    sensitive to the difficulties surrounding the measurement of experience. --

    This study examined the impact of three dimensions of digital literacy on
    privacy-related online behaviors: (a) familiarity with technical aspects of
    the Internet, (b) awareness of common institutional practices, and (c)
    understanding of current privacy policy. Hierarchical regression models
    analyzed data from a national sample of 419 adult Internet users. The
    analyses showed strong predictive powers of user knowledge, as indicated by
    the three discrete dimensions, on privacy control behavior. However, the
    findings were mixed when accounting for the interaction between knowledge
    and Internet experiences. There were limitations on the extents of knowledge
    and action related to personalized information. Furthermore, those
    limitations divided with sociodemographic characteristics such as age,
    gender, income, and education. Ramifications for the current status of the
    FTC policy are discussed.

    live-coding to teach introductory programming. The research design includes
    two experimental groups spread across four sections of an introductory C++
    course at Colorado School of Mines. In the control group, students were
    taught using static code, meaning that instructors never typed, but instead
    viewed, compiled, and executed code examples. In the experimental or
    "live-coding" group, instructors started each lecture with a blank screen,
    and taught code examples by systematically typing, compiling, and testing
    code to solve example problems. To assess the effectiveness of live-coding,
    we administered four surveys and analyzed final grades. Two of the surveys
    were given at the beginning of the course, and were used to measure baseline
    programming knowledge and student learning preferences (i.e., VARK). The
    other two surveys, given at the end of the course, were designed to measure
    the amount of programming knowledge obtained as well as preferences towards
    live coding. Lastly, final grades were analyzed in terms of its
    subcomponents: the assignments, exams, final project, and overall grade.
    Based on our results, we conclude that teaching via live-coding is as good
    as if not better than using static code examples.

  abstract: "There is a long history of experimental and exploratory\r\n    programming\r\n    supported by systems that expose interaction through a\r\n    programming\r\n    language interface. These live programming systems enable\r\n    software\r\n    developers to create, extend, and modify the behaviour of\r\n    executing\r\n    software by changing source code without perceptual breaks for\r\n    recompilation. These live programming systems have taken many\r\n    forms,\r\n    but have generally been limited in their ability to express\r\n    low-level\r\n    programming concepts and the generation of efficient native\r\n    machine\r\n    code. These shortcomings have limited the effectiveness of live\r\n    programming in domains that require highly efficient numerical\r\n    processing and explicit memory management.\r\n    \r\n    The most general questions addressed by this thesis are what a\r\n    systems\r\n    language designed for live programming might look like and how\r\n    such a\r\n    language might influence the development of live programming in\r\n    performance sensitive domains requiring real-time support,\r\n    direct\r\n    hardware control, or high performance computing. This thesis\r\n    answers\r\n    these questions by exploring the design, implementation and\r\n    application of Extempore, a new systems programming language,\r\n    designed specifically for live interactive programming."

    Background

    Over the past four years, the Franciscan University Counseling Center has
    reported a 231% increase in yearly visits, as well as a 173% increase in
    total yearly clients. This trend has been observed at many universities as
    mental health issues pose significant problems for many college students.
    The objective of this study was to investigate potential correlates of
    depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students.

    Methods

    The final analyzed sample consisted of 374 undergraduate students between
    the ages of 18 and 24 attending Franciscan University, Steubenville, Ohio.
    Subjects completed a survey consisting of demographic questions, a section
    instructing participants to rate the level of concern associated with
    challenges pertinent to daily life (e.g. academics, family, sleep), and the
    21 question version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21).

    Results

    The results indicated that the top three concerns were academic performance,
    pressure to succeed, and post-graduation plans. Demographically, the most
    stressed, anxious, and depressed students were transfers, upperclassmen, and
    those living off-campus.

    Conclusions

    With the propensity for mental health issues to hinder the success of
    college students, it is vital that colleges continually evaluate the mental
    health of their students and tailor treatment programs to specifically
    target their needs.

    Current educational policy is dominated by a discourse of transferability,
    scalability and innovation, within a climate politicised by 'creative
    industries' and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
    education in Australia. STEM has been promoted as an authentic and engaging
    approach to education, particularly as Australia tries to boost its
    performance in international testing. However, STEM has consistently been
    challenged by STEAM, where 'arts and design' represent the 'A'. STEAM
    advocates for creativity and expression to be included as a core part of any
    interdisciplinary approach. There is no defensible reason why the 'A' of
    arts should not be included in domain interconnectedness and the development
    of critical and creative thinking skills' preparation of students for the
    global economy. Assessing the 'state of play' involving STEM and STEAM in
    Australia, this paper considers the widespread adoption of STEM in
    education, and its missed opportunity for integrating arts skills and
    capacities into the creativity agenda. Harris (2016) has argued in favour of
    a more 'ecological' whole-school approach to fostering creativity that
    promotes not only creative approaches to STEM subjects, but importantly arts
    subjects as well, including environmental, partnership and professional
    development components. The Harris Creativity Index is reviewed, and salient
    creative skills and capacities posited which allows teachers to implement
    pedagogical procedures that can improve creativity within schools through
    more whole-school transdisciplinary STEAM approaches.

    The general problem of visualizing "family trees", or genealogical graphs,
    in 2D, is considered. A graph theoretic analysis is given, which identifies
    why genealogical graphs can be difficult to draw. This motivates some novel
    graphical representations, including one based on a dual tree, a subgraph
    formed by the union of two trees. Dual trees can be drawn in various styles,
    including an indented outline style, and allow users to browse general
    multitrees in addition to genealogical graphs, by transitioning between
    different dual tree views. A software prototype for such browsing is
    described, that supports smoothly animated transitions, automatic camera
    framing, rotation of subtrees, and a novel interaction technique for
    expanding or collapsing subtrees to any depth with a single mouse drag

    This article summarises the current state of research into multiple tree
    visualisations. It discusses the spectrum of current representation
    techniques used on single trees, pairs of trees and finally multiple trees,
    in order to identify which representations are best suited to particular
    tasks and to find gaps in the representation space, in which opportunities
    for future multiple tree visualisation research may exist. The application
    areas from where multiple tree data are derived are enumerated, and the
    distinct structures that multiple trees make in combination with each other
    and the effect on subsequent approaches to their visualisation are
    discussed, along with the basic high-level goals of existing multiple tree
    visualisations.

    We present TimeNets, a new visualization technique for genealogical data.
    Most genealogical diagrams prioritize the display of generational relations.
    To enable analysis of families over time, TimeNets prioritize temporal
    relationships in addition to family structure. Individuals are represented
    using timelines that converge and diverge to indicate marriage and divorce;
    directional edges connect parents and children. This representation both
    facilitates perception of temporal trends and provides a substrate for
    communicating non-hierarchical patterns such as divorce, remarriage, and
    plural marriage. We also apply degree-of-interest techniques to enable
    scalable, interactive exploration. We present our design decisions, layout
    algorithm, and a study finding that TimeNets accelerate analysis tasks
    involving temporal data.
