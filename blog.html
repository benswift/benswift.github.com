<p>
  This is my blog. Sometimes in these posts I’ll talk about research or
  art projects I’m involved with, although I also blog about my research
  on the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/news/">c/c/c blog</a>.
  Sometimes I’ll just ramble about other stuff which is keeping me up at night.
