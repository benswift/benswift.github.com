<p>This is my personal blog. Because I’m an academic, my work-life balance is a
bit rubbish (although I’m always trying to do better—it <em>is</em> important to switch off).</p>

<p>Sometimes in these posts I’ll talk about research or art projects I’m
involved with, although I also blog about my research on the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/news/">c/c/c blog</a>. Sometimes I’ll just ramble about other stuff which is keeping me up at night. The stuff I write here represents my own views, not those of my employer.</p>

<p>Anyway, on with the show!</p>
