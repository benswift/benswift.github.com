This is my personal blog. Because I'm an academic, my work-life balance is a bit
rubbish (although I'm always trying to do better---it *is* important to switch
off).

Sometimes in these posts I'll talk about research or art projects I'm involved
with, although I also blog about my research on the [c/c/c
blog](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/news/). Sometimes, however
I'll just ramble about other stuff which is keeping me up at night. The stuff I
write here represents my own views, not those of my employer.

Anyway, on with the show!
