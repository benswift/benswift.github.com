Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a hacker, digital artist and [Senior Lecturer in
computer science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift) at the Australian
National University in Canberra, Australia, where I lead the
[code/creativity/culture group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
research group. The c/c/c group exists to open up spaces for discussion about
way that code is shaping flows of information/culture/humanity in today's (and
tomorrow's) world. You can read more about the c/c/c group at [their
website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/).

This is my personal homepage & [blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link blog.md %}), where
I can wax lyrical about my [research]({{site.baseurl}}{% link research.md %}),
[teaching]({{site.baseurl}}{% link teaching.md %}), and the [thoughts in my
head]({{site.baseurl}}{% link blog.md %}).

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---the best options are
