Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a
[scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OQdYgLEAAAAJ),
[artist](https://vimeo.com/benswift) and [hacker](https://github.com/benswift).

I'm a [Senior Lecturer](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift) in the
[Research School of Computer Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian
National University in Canberra, Australia, where I lead the
[code/creativity/culture group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
research group. The **c/c/c group** exists to open up spaces for discussion
about the way that `code` is shaping flows of information/culture/humanity in
today's (and tomorrow's) world. You can read more at the [c/c/c group
website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/).

This is my personal homepage & [blog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link blog.html %}),
where I can wax lyrical about my [research]({{site.baseurl}}{% link research.md
%})/[creative practice]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.html %}),
[teaching]({{site.baseurl}}{% link teaching.md %}), and the [thoughts in my
head]({{site.baseurl}}{% link blog.html %}).

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---the best options are
