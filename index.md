Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a
[scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OQdYgLEAAAAJ), [artist]({%
link livecoding.md %}) and [hacker](https://github.com/benswift), and one of the
core developers of the [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore)
livecoding environment (<a style="vertical-align: sub;"
href="https://github.com/digego/extempore/stargazers"><img style="width:unset;"
alt="GitHub stars"
src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/digego/extempore"></a>).

I'm a [Senior Lecturer](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift) in the
[Research School of Computer Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian
National University in Canberra, Australia, where I lead the
[code/creativity/culture
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/). The **c/c/c studio** is
a research group which exists to open up spaces for discussion about the way
that `code` is shaping flows of information/culture/humanity in today's (and
tomorrow's) world. You can read more at the [c/c/c studio
website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/).

This is my homepage & [blog]({% link blog.md %}), where I can
wax lyrical about my [research]({% link research.md
%})/[creative practice]({% link livecoding.md %}),
[teaching]({% link teaching.md %}), and the [thoughts in my
head]({% link blog.md %}). You can navigate to the main areas
([blog]({% link blog.md %}), [research]({%
link research.md %}), etc.) using the navbar at the top of the page (and there
are a few external links as well).

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---the best options are
