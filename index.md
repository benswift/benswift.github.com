Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a hacker, digital artist and computer science lecturer
at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. I lead the
**code/creativity/culture** group[^ccc-website], a new research group within the
Research School of Computer Science. The c/c/c group exists to open up spaces
for discussion about way that code is shaping flows of
information/culture/humanity in today's (and tomorrow's) world.

[^ccc-website]: the c/c/c group doesn't have a web presence just yet, but it's coming soon

This is my personal homepage & [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/), where I can wax
lyrical about the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) I'm involved in, the
[students]({{ site.baseurl }}/students/) I'm supervising, and the [thoughts]({{
site.baseurl }}/blog/) in my head.

If you'd like to get in touch, then get in touch on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) or send me an email
on <mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au>.
