Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a hacker, digital artist and computer science lecturer
at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. I lead the
[code/creativity/culture group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/),
a new research group within the Research School of Computer Science. The c/c/c
group exists to open up spaces for discussion about way that code is shaping
flows of information/culture/humanity in today's (and tomorrow's) world. You can
read more about the c/c/c group at [their
website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/).

This is my personal homepage & [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/), where I can wax
lyrical about the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) I'm involved in, the
[students]({{ site.baseurl }}/students/) I'm supervising, and the [thoughts]({{
site.baseurl }}/blog/) in my head.

If you'd like to get in touch, then get in touch on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) or send me an email
on <mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au>.
