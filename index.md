Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a hacker, digital artist and computer science lecturer
at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.

This is my personal homepage & blog, where I can wax lyrical about
the [projects](/projects/) I'm involved in, the [students](/students/) I'm
supervising, and the [thoughts](/blog/) in my head. If you'd like to get in
touch, then send me an email on <mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au>
