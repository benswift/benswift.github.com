Computers are just so _useful_ in all domains of human endeavour, and giving
people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. I
really enjoy it, too :)

I'm currently teaching two courses in the [ANU Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)

- [COMP2710: Laptop
  Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/) in **Semester 1
  (Feb--Jun)**

- [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
  Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) in **Semester 2 (Jul-Nov)**

In the past couple of years, I've also taught

- [COMP2300: Computer Organisation and Program
  Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) **Semester 1
  (Feb-Jun)**---this course is still running, but it's now being taught by my
  colleague [Charles Martin](http://charlesmartin.com.au/) (don't worry, it's
  still the same discoboard-powered extravaganza that I wrote and taught since
  2017 ðŸ˜œ)

- [_Internet of Things_ China Study
  Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) at the Beijing
  Institute of Technology--the above photo was taken during the 2018 version of
  this course (although sadly [it's not running this year]({% link
  _posts/2019-10-14-iot-china-study-tour-not-happening-in-2019.md %}))

If you're a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or more!) of
these courses---I think they're pretty great :)

I also give regular [guest lectures]({% link talks.md %}) &
run workshops on various topics in my areas of expertise. If you're interested
in hiring me as a speaker, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
