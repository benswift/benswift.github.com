I'm a [Canberra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) lad, born and
bred. One day I may have to move away from this place, but for now I'm
here and quite happy about it.

I have one wife, one kid, zero pets, three bikes and four guitars. They all make
me happy (in monotonically weakly decreasing order).

On the weekends I ride my mountain bike, play football (soccer), watch the footy
(afl) and cricket and go to church. I'm also trying to learn Mandarin so that I
can better communicate with my in-laws. Ask me how I'm going with that in a
year.
