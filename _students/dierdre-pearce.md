Dierdre is interested in the implications of a pervasive digital network on
individuals' sense of self. She is using sculpture, installation and performance
to explore what might happen when mental faculties such as memory,
communication, cognition and sensory functions are delegated to, or absorbed by,
larger external entities. In particular, she is developing ways of imagining her
collected digital data in three dimensions, and speculating on the relationship
between these and her biological information (such as DNA and proteins). Is her
digital presence a copy, a portrait, a prosthesis, or something else entirely?
Her research is based in visual arts and draws on ideas from biological
chemistry, design, computer science and the humanities.
