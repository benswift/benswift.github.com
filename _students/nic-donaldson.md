Nic is interested in live coding and systems programming. He is working with
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) to explore how we can program
and control powerful small, cheap ARM systems (such as the Raspberri Pi)
*interactively* and *remotely*. The guiding question is "how can we interact
with embedded systems after they have been installed, so they continue to be
useful?"
