<!-- Computers are just so *useful* in all domains of human endeavour, and giving -->
<!-- people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. -->
<!-- Because of this, I put a lot of effort into teaching undergraduate and -->
<!-- masters-level Computer Science in my current job in the Research School of -->
<!-- Computer Science at the Australian National University. -->

I'm currently teaching two courses:

- in **Semester 1 (Feb-Jun)** I teach [*COMP2300: Computer Organisation and
  Program Execution*](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)

- in **Semester 2 (Jul-Nov)** I teach [*COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
  Media*](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)

If you're a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or both!) of
these courses---I think they're pretty great :)

I also give regular guest lectures & run workshops on various topics in my areas
of expertise. If you're interested in hiring me as a
speaker, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
