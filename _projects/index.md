I am a multidisciplinary researcher in the Research School of Computer Science
at the [Australian National
University](http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/4919). I'm interested in
computational art, data visualisation, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity
(particularly in embedded devices) and the the intersection of code, creativity
and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. I lead the
code/creativity/culture group at the ANU Resesarch School of Computer Science.

I love building things, and one thing I'm particularly excited about in these
areas is the potential of **liveness** (real-time human-in-the-loop
interactivity) in programming tools and workflows. I have made significant
[open-source code contributions](https://github.com/benswift) to the
international research and livecoding communities, especially through my work on
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore): the state-of-the-art in
livecoding languages.

I am also an internationally-recognised digital artist, and have performed at
both local and international arts festivals---you can find examples of my
[livecoding on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/benswift/videos).

If you want to get in touch, email is best---you can reach me on
<ben.swift@anu.edu.au>.
