<p>

  I’m often invited to give talks &amp; presentations. Because knowledge is
  better when it’s shared, I’ve made all my slides freely available here—just
  click on any of the titles below. However, often my slides don’t make sense in
  isolation (if had everything I said written on my slides and just read it out
  my talks would be <strong>really boring</strong>).

  I am available as a guest speaker (and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.html %}">livecoding</a>
  performer) for both scholarly and corportate-y events. If
  you’re interested then <a href="mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au">drop me a
  line</a> and we can discuss making it happen.
