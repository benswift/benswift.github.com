I've been lucky to work with some amazing students. Head to the [c/c/c group
website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/people/) to see what the
current crop are up to.

### Come study with me

If you're interested in doing Honours/Masters/PhD research with me, [send me an
email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au). I always have a few project ideas kicking
around, but I'm also open to hearing about the project/big idea that excites
*you*. Send me

1. a **one-paragraph** description of what you're interested in, and
2. a link to something you've made: a livecoding video, a project on GitHub, an
   academic paper---even a blog post
