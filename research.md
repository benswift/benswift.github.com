## Research interests

I am a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the Research School
of Computer Science at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). I'm interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. I'm the
director of the [code/creativity/culture
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) at the ANU Research
School of Computer Science.

<!-- TODO: update link to c/c/c projects page once the new cccstudio website is live -->

I am a **livecoder**, and have performed at both local and international arts
festivals---you can find recordings of some of my sets [on my livecoding
page]({% link livecoding.md %}). I'm the vice president of the [Australasian
Computer Music Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA)[^acmc]. I'm
also one of the inaugural [ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.

[^acmc]:
    **shameless plug**: you should [submit a paper or creative
    work](http://acmc2020.com/#/features/03-submission) to our [annual
    conference](http://acmc2020.com), which we're hosting at the ANU in July
    2020

I love building things, and one thing I'm particularly excited about is the
potential of **liveness** (real-time human-in-the-loop interactivity) in
programming tools and workflows. I have made significant [open-source code
contributions](https://github.com/benswift) to the international research and
livecoding communities, especially through my work on
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore): the state-of-the-art in
livecoding languages.

**Come study with me**: if you're interested in doing Honours/Masters/PhD
research with me, [send me an email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au). I always have
a few project ideas kicking around, but I'm also open to hearing about the
project/big idea that excites _you_. Send me

1. a **one-paragraph** description of the project you're interested in doing,
   and
2. a **link to something you've made**: a livecoding video, a project on GitHub,
   an academic paper---even a blog post

I get a lot of emails about this sort of thing, so including these two things is
a great way to show that you've thought a bit about what sort of research
project you're interested in (and why I'd be a good fit). You should think hard
about how to make your email stand out from the crowd.
