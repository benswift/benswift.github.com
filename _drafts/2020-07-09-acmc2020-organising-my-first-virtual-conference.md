title: 'ACMC2020: organising my first virtual conference'
---

I've been a bit quiet on this blog for the last few weeks[^weeks] because I've
been organising [ACMC2020](https://acmc2020.com/) the 2020 Australasian Computer
Music Conference. It's been a lot of hard work, but the other members of the
[organising committee](https://acmc2020.com/#Organisers) are _amazing_, so it's
been pretty fun as well.

[^weeks]:
    well, it's actually pretty common that I'm quiet for a few weeks, so I
    guess it's business as usual
    
The conference is still ongoing (a special shout-out to tune in for [Eve
Klein's](https://acmc2020.com/speaker_eve-klein.html) on diversity & inclusion
in computer music/music tech), and so we'll have a bit celebration (and
post-mortem) when it's all done to figure out what went well and what didn't.
