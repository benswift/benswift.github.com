```xtlang
(bind-func my-test-7
  (lambda ()
	(let ((a:<i64,double>* (alloc)) ; returns pointer to type <i64,double>
		  (b 37)
		  (c 6.4))
	  (tuple-set! a 0 b) ;; set i64 to 64
	  (tset! a 1 c) ;; set double to 6.4 - tset! is an alias for tuple-set!
	  (printf "tuple:1 %lld::%f\n" (tuple-ref a 0) (tref a 1))
	  ;; we can fill a tuple in a single call by using tfill!
	  (tfill! a 77 77.7)
	  (printf "tuple:2 %lld::%f\n" (tuple-ref a 0) (tuple-ref a 1))
	  (tuple-ref a 0)))) ;; return first element which is i64
```

And just to make sure that it still works with the other languages that I like
(or in some cases, hatecode):

```scheme
(define ben-doubler 
  (lambda (x)
    (* x 2)))
```

Wow. That's so great.
