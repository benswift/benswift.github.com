title: Respectful Learning Memes

A few years ago I re-wrote one of our core [computer architecture
courses](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) (it has the course code
COMP2300). While I'm not teaching it this semester, it's still a course dear to
my heart. It's a large (400+ students) compulsory course, so there's a spread of
different levels of interest, aptitude & enthusiasm in the student cohort.

One of the tricky parts of COMP2300 is that we don't use a high-level
programming language---one with recognisable keywords like `if`, `else`, `for`, etc.
Instead, all the programming is done in "assembly" language, which
is _fairly_ close to the direct stream of bytes that the CPU sees as it's
executing your code. While this is a great chance to learn how CPUs work, the
unfamiliarity can be challenging---and the students aren't shy about saying so.

## The hidden communication channels

One thing that I've discovered over the last few years is that for every
"official" course forum/communication channel there's _at least_ one shadow
channel that's created somewhere else. These
Facebook/WhatsApp/Insta/WeChat/TikTok/etc. groups are where the students really
let their hair down and say what they think about the course.

One surprising (to me) upside of these channels is that as the students chat
with one another, they come up with some really helpful explanations of the
concepts they're strugging with in the course. And they're _really_ good at
making **memes**. Here are just a few of the ones which ended up on the allowed
"cheat sheets" in the final exam.

I don't know where they came from---at least some of them were created
specifically for COMP2300. But I know from talking to students that they
actually helped them understand and remember key concepts from the course.

## Harnessing students as content creators

Like many academics around the world, I'm currently brushing up my course
syllabus for the new semester (which starts _next week_ as I'm writing this).
And I'm sure the students will make new memes for (among other things)
explaining the course content to each other.

However, if that happens on the "secret" channels then that's obviously not good
for equity---I want to make sure all students benefit, not just the ones in the
right FB Messenger group. So this year I'm going to include a meme thread as
part of the official course forum. Since it's an official course communication
channel I'm sure it'll be kept respectful, and all students can benefit. And as
I teach bigger and more diverse classes, the chance to harness these students'
brilliance in meme-making (and some of them are _seriously_ good at it) to help
all my students learn seems like a win. Can't wait to see what they come up with
:)
