## Brief

You're a curriculum designer for the c/c/c studio! Welcome aboard.

**Today's task**: in groups, come up with an assessment task which explores a
_problem_ through a creative _process_ using a particular _tool_. You don't get
to pick the _problem_, _process_ & _tool_ though---we'll let the wheel decide.

At the end of this workshop, your group will produce (and present to the rest of
us) two things:

- an assignment spec: brief description & motivation, any specific restraints or
  requirements, and 

- a set of learning outcomes / assessment criteria which will be used to assess
  the submissions for your assignment

### To get you started...

- as for the age/background of the students, it's up to you---e.g. early
  high-school one-off workshop, year 11/12 extension program (i.e. the c/c/c
  studio), first-year assignment at uni, graduate-level coursework, etc.

- these problems are _not solvable in a single assessment task_, so don't make
  that the criteria---instead, you want students to explore & understand the
  problem, process & tool more deeply

- think: how might the _tool_ and the _process_ shape the responses to the
  problem? can you use this to your advantage in encouraging students to attain
  the learning outcomes?

- how are you going to constrain the scope of your task so that it supports
  students from a wide range of backgrounds/abilities?

### code

The _tool_ (or class of tools) which the students need to leverage in their
creative response. This is deliberately broad---you can (and should) narrow it
down in _your_ assessment task spec.

Note: one other way to frame this is this is the skill/concept that you want the
students to learn (perhaps surreptitiously) in _doing_ the assessment task.
