## Project Background and Description

### Elevator pitch {#elevator-pitch}

{:.hl-para}

I want to create the **c/c/c studio**[^ccc-group], an extension/outreach program
in creative code: using code to make art, music & other cool things. Through
school- & community-based workshops and a weekly on-campus studio masterclass,
students will be part of an interactive learning community where they will be
guided by instructors in creating their own new works of code-based art & music.
At the end of each semester the c/c/c studio will host a "grad show" gallery
exhibition/performance of the students' work. This program will attract
fantastic students who might otherwise not study engineering or computer science
(either at ANU or elsewhere) and engage the wider community in helping them
_reimagine_ what it is to be a computer scientist or engineer in the 21st
century.

[^ccc-group]:
    named after the
    [code/creativity/culture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
    (c/c/c) research group that I lead, which already has some name recognition
    around the place and will be useful for "branding" this activity

### Problems to be addressed

Interest in Computer Science (CS) education is exploding at all educational
levels, but there's a lack of support for students in schools[^schools] which
don't have specialist teachers or an appropriate learning
environment---especially for "fun" student-driven projects which go beyond
textbook exercises. At the ANU [Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) we're not currently
doing very much[^not-doing-much] to engage with students at a pre-tertiary
level, mostly because we're flat-out dealing with the huge growth in students at
a tertiary level. The c/c/c studio will address that.

[^schools]:
    In this project I'm mainly thinking of later high-school and college
    students (i.e. years 9--12), although there is certainly the possibility of
    tweaking the content to engage younger (even primary school) students as
    well.

[^not-doing-much]:
   I don't mean to throw shade on our existing efforts here---there are some
   great things happening in this area, but there's more to be done for sure.

CS still suffers from a stereotype of being "for nerdy white/Asian males", and
those groups are certainly over-represented in our undergraduate CS cohort
compared to other groups. It's important to point out that increasing the
representation of under-represented groups in CS is a wicked problem which needs
to be tackled from many different angles. Still, as the **A** in
[STE**A**M](http://stemtosteam.org), the **a**rts provide one angle for engaging
students who might not normally coding and computer science.

### Existing alternatives

Some ACT High Schools & Colleges already have great non-traditional/creative
CS/IT programs (I plan to partner with teachers at these schools as [early
adopters](#early-adopters)). However, even in these cases there's a missing link
once students finish High School---where can they go to further develop their
creative practice? The c/c/c studio program will give them deep links &
relationships into the ANU (across both CS and the Schools of Art & Design and
School of Music) and an avenue for continuing their creative work.

There are a few outreach programs [advertised on the CECS
website](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/more-information/outreach-programs-schools),
however the listed programs are dominated by Engineering rather than CS (9 vs 4
programs) and of the 4 CS programs I'm involved with 2 of them already. There's
also the official [ANU Extension](http://extension.anu.edu.au) scheme for Year
11 & 12 students in the ACT, however CS doesn't yet participate in this scheme.
Across campus, there's the ANU School of Music's [Open School of
Music](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/open-school) for school students, but
there's no music technology stream.

There are several great organisations working to increase diversity in CS,
including the [Canberra Girls' Programming
Network](https://canberragpn.github.io), [Code Like a
Girl](https://codelikeagirl.org/states/act/),
[Robogals](https://robogals.org/locations/asia-pacific-apac/canberra/). However,
these organisations are primarily based around computer science/engineering, not
interdisciplinary art & code.

In 2018 I ran the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/projects/laptop-ensemble/),
which attempted to provide a similar open-ended space for creative exploration
to the c/c/c studio, specifically for live performance (code-based DJ-ing and
VJ-ing). ANU students can take my [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) course as part of a major in
either a CS degree or a Bachelor of Visual Arts (or indeed as a cross-campus
elective in any program). COMP1720 has run successfully as a cross-disciplinary
"learn to code" course for several years. The c/c/c studio will extend this
opportunity to school students and other members of the ACT community.

I see the c/c/c studio as an opportunity to formalise and build momentum around
all of these existing initiatives, partnering with them wherever possible.

## Project Scope

### Solution proposed

The c/c/c studio will be developed through three stages:

1. In **stage one** (mid 2019--end 2019) I will engage with the project's
   [stakeholders](#project-sponsor-and-stakeholders) to form a **c/c/c studio
   advisory group** responsible for guiding high-level strategy and pedagogy in
   the c/c/c studio program
2. In **stage two** (beginning 2020--end 2020) we will design and run a series
   of creative code workshops (approx. one per month) with our [early
   adopter](#early-adopters) schools and community groups. These free workshops
   will be marketed to specific target groups (as determined by the advisory
   group). Through these workshop we will develop a curriculum of
   different creative activities for different audiences, and also build a
   community (local artists, CECS academics, ANU undergraduate & postgraduate
   students) capable of delivering these workshops.
3. In **stage three** (beginning 2021--end 2021) we will officially launch the
   weekly on-campus c/c/c studio & masterclass. The weekly c/c/c studio sessions
   won't be lectures, or even tutorials---they will adopt a [studio-based
   learning](https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/assessing-studio-based-learning)
   model, with each student working on their own code-based music or visual
   artwork as a semester-long creative "work". The [Studio Teaching
   Project](http://www.studioteaching.org) (a research collaboration between
   UNSW, UQ, RMIT and UTas) has released some helpful material for employing
   this teaching model, which we will make use of in developing the c/c/c
   curriculum.

The purpose of stages one and two is design and road-test the details of the
c/c/c studio sessions & masterclasses, but here are some initial plans:

- ACT High School & College students will apply to participate based on interest
  and aptitude
- the weekly c/c/c studio session will be 2hrs long, held on campus at an
  after-school-friendly timeslot
- students will commit to attending for a semester, culminating in a public grad
  show exhibition/performance at the end of the semester
- each session will be small---max 20 students with 1 instructor (Ben) and one
  tutor (we will recruit tutors with the appropriate skills as required based on
  c/c/c studio student numbers)
- students will be exposed to regular guest "masterclasses" (3-4 times per semester) from 
  artists and other creative practitioners from CECS, the ANU School of Art &
  Design & School of Music, and the local arts community
- students will be able to select either a music or visual art emphasis in their
  projects, with sub-communities for each emphasis
- initial "training" material will also be adapted from the [COMP1720 lab
  material](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/labs/) and tweaked as
  appropriate

{: #anu-extension-accreditation}

It may be possible give participants in the c/c/c studio program credit into our
first-year CS program (e.g. [COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/))
if they decide to come and study in CECS.[^discovering-engineering] To
investigate this, in stage two we will put the c/c/c studio program forward as a
candidate for the [ANU Extension program](http://extension.anu.edu.au). This may
or may not be desirable (depending on the requirements of the Extension program)
but we should investigate whether it's a good fit for increasing the profile,
standing and utility of the c/c/c studio.

[^discovering-engineering]:
    This is the same as the equivalent [Discovering Engineering extension
    program](http://extension.anu.edu.au/study/discovering-engineering), which
    gives students credit for a first-year ENGN course if they study Engineering
    at the ANU.

### Value to organisation/Reimagine strategic alignment

The c/c/c studio aligns strongly with the goals of the Reimagine project,
specifically in people, students, education and engagement.

From the [Reimagine Project page](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine):

> We will inspire a new generation of high-potential, creative people to come to
> engineering and computing with a diverse range of interests, motivations,
> perspectives and career aspirations.

This "new generation" will not be won over by glossy brochures and fancy new
buildings---they will come because they can see concrete ways in which their
diverse range of interests can be harnessed and _put to work_ to do amazing
things. The c/c/c studio will provide a supportive community in which this new
generation of **people** can learn, create, and share. More than that, it will
unlock the latent potential in **students** who never knew their diverse interests
(especially in the arts & music) _could_ be used in engineering and computing.

The c/c/c studio provides a test-bed for new modes of computing **education**,
especially the studio teaching model. The Reimagine project's "[big
tent](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization#h-acm’s-‘big-tent’-philosophy-embraces-diversity)"
CS education philosophy requires us to attract _and nurture_ a broader range of
students in our undergraduate and postgraduate programs. In building a community
of students who are interested in using computers in the arts & music the c/c/c
studio can be _one part_ of that bigger mission.

The c/c/c studio is an outwardly-focused program. Through the workshops (stage
two) and c/c/c studio (stage three) we will **engage** local artists (whose work
includes code/digital techniques) to teach into our studio masterclasses. The
end-of-semester grad shows (stage three) provide an opportunity to showcase the
innovative education & creative-practice going on in the c/c/c studio (and CECS
more broadly) and in doing so to make an impact in the ANU and wider Canberra
community.

Finally, all the activities of the c/c/c studio function as an "object lesson"
for the breadth of places that an Engineering/Computer Science skillset can be
applied---a crucial part of Reimagining CECS from a problem-solving to
problem-_finding_ institution.

### Target users

ACT High School students, as well as students from the wider Canberra region
(since we could do a travelling version of the workshop). Through the c/c/c
advisory group, we also plan (in stage one) to identify and target specific
communities under-represented in our undergraduate CS programs.

Also, teachers from these schools will be encouraged to partner with us in both
supporting their students to participate in the c/c/c studio, and also to
incorporate creative arts & code activities in their classrooms in general (e.g.
using the c/c/c studio curriculum, which will be made freely available).

### Early adopters {#early-adopters}

In stage one I will build on my (and others) existing relationships in
identifying early adopters. In schools, I will work with teachers from [Dickson
College](http://www.dicksonc.act.edu.au), [Radford
College](https://www.radford.act.edu.au), [Lyneham
High](http://lynehamhs.act.edu.au), [Canberra (Boys)
Grammar](https://cgs.act.edu.au) and [Canberra Girls
Grammar](https://www.cggs.act.edu.au). I will also work with relevant community
& arts "special interest" organisations, such as
[Robogals](https://robogals.org/locations/asia-pacific-apac/canberra/),
[Canberra Girls' Programming Network](https://canberragpn.github.io) and SCI ART
CBR. These groups, with their networks and existing groups of students
interested in creative code, can host workshops (stage two) and serve as "seed"
populations for the first semester of c/c/c studio sessions in stage three.

## Deliverables {#deliverables}

This project will deliver:

- a **curriculum** (including instructor notes) for the weekly c/c/c studio
  sessions, which will be freely released to the public under a creative commons
  licence ([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))

- a biannual **c/c/c studio grad show** gallery exhibition and music performance
  (recorded and released on YouTube/Spotify) held on campus (perhaps in the new
  cultural centre) as the capstone for each semester's student work in the c/c/c
  studio

- stories for CECS/Reimagine marketing, and c/c/c studio "graduates" will be
  ideal student ambassadors for the new horizons that creative code opens up

- (TBC) [RSCS's](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) first ANU
  Extension program (see [above](#anu-extension-accreditation))

There'll be lots of other stuff, too: building a community of practice,
deepening ANU CS/CECS's relationships with ACT High Schools, giving our
undergraduate students a chance to mentor these high school students, etc. But
that's intangible stuff, so I'm not sure if they count as a deliverables.

## Success Metrics {#success-metrics}

We will judge the success of this program using the following metrics, both in
absolute terms and also trends over time.

- **Participation**: how many students participate in the workshops (stage two)
  and c/c/c studio (stage three)?
- **Creative outputs**: we'll have an end-of-semester concert and gallery
  show---are the things the students are making any good?
- **Curriculum uptake**: is the curriculum developed for the c/c/c studio
  sessions used by HS teachers to run similar groups in their schools?

Attaching numbers to this sort of thing is fraught, but here are some indicative
targets:

| stage  | activity        | target                                                                                   |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| two    | workshops       | run one half-day workshop per month (or equivalent), with at least 10 students each time |
| three  | c/c/c studio    | 10 successful c/c/c studio "graduates" in S1 2020, 15 successful graduates in S2 2020    |
| three+ | CECS enrolments | 5 graduates of the c/c/c studio (in year 12 in 2020) enrolling in CS at the ANU          |

## Business Readiness

### Physical space

The c/c/c studio (stage three) will require a room for one 2-3 hour session
every week in an after-school friendly timeslot (perhaps 4pm-6pm). This room
needs to have one computer per student (either a lab machine or personal laptop)
which can run a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). One of our
computer labs in Building #145 should do the job initially.

### Personnel

The c/c/c studio's open-ended studio teaching model _does_ require a range of
expert instructors with a mix of creative and technical skills. In addition to
my own expertise in this area, Dr. Charles Martin (another creative code
researcher) has recently been employed as a Lecturer by the RSCS, and will be an
asset to the c/c/c studio program. There are also several academic creative
practitioners across campus at the ANU Schools of Art & Design and Schools of
Music. it will be necessary be opportunities/needs to buy out small amounts of
their time to contribute to the c/c/c studio masterclasses (stage three).

### Admin

We will require public liability insurance for any students who come onto campus
for the c/c/c studio sessions.
  
## Key Activities

| c/c/c studio grad show                                                       | students       | stage three (beginning mid-2021) |

## Cost/Time Commitments

**Ben**: 2 days/week (40% FTE) for 2.5 years (mid 2019-end 2021). This includes:

1. managing the c/c/c studio advisory group
2. building relationships with High Schools and recruiting students (from stage one)
3. developing the curriculum (from stage one)
4. running workshops (~monthly from stage two)
3. delivering the weekly c/c/c studio session(s) (weekly from stage three)

The 0.4fte buyout associated with this fellowship will be used to cover 100% of
my service component (currently 0.2fte) and half of my teaching component
(currently 0.4fte). One possible way to manage this is me giving up my role as
student experience convenor (service) and moving from single-lecturer to leading
a two-lecturer teaching team for both COMP1720 and COMP2300. However, this is
subject to negotiations with the relevant authorities within RSCS 😉

**Tutors**: depending on how many students attend, we will need to employ one
(or more) of our undergraduate students to help deliver the workshops (stage
two) and support the students in the c/c/c studio (stage three).

**Equipment**: computational art & music supplies (~5k), including:
- portable music PA for running music workshops in schools
- high-resolution monitors for display of digital artworks

**Artist honoraria**[^plural]: some of the guest artists who give masterclasses
in the studio won't have institutional affiliation, and paying them for their
time is a way of respecting their contribution & expertise.

**Grad show budget**: (~1k per semester from stage three) for
venue/catering/equipment (e.g. fancy projectors, etc.)

| description      | cost                                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Ben's time       | 0.4fte @ level C                                    |
| tutors           | 5h/workshop in stage two, 3h/session in stage three |
| artist honoraria | as above, but potentially at a different rate       |

[^plural]: actually, is _honoraria_ the plural of honorarium?

## Notes for readers

- It's currently a CS pitch---there's not much involvement from the Engineering
  schools at present, although this could change in the future. But I've decided
  to start with what I know.

- Some of the nomenclature is still TBC, e.g. the whole "c/c/c studio" thing,
  code vs technology, art vs music vs creativity, etc. Part of the initial phase
  of the project will be workshopping these terms to see which ones best
  resonate with the potential audiences, and also which best capture what
  _actually_ goes on.

- It's _really hard_ to have all the necessary stakeholder conversations while
  I'm on parental leave. So while I've discussed this sort of thing to varying
  degrees with [everyone concerned](#project-sponsor-and-stakeholders) (i.e. I'm
  sure no-one would be *shocked* to hear this project pitch) there's a chance
  that some of the details will change as I make things more concrete and sort
  out the details.

- In some ways the budget is quite conservative---there's certainly the chance
  that I could hire/buy out the time of both ANU colleagues from art, design &
  music, or perhaps buy the time of members from some of the other organisations
  (e.g. Madeleine from SCI ART CBR and I have discussed this). So I'm happy to
  include that in the budget if there's an appetite for it, but I'd also need to
  chat with the relevant folks first.

- If things go well, I intend to continue (and grow!) the program past the end
  of 2021---in fact I see it as an ongoing part of our teaching, research and
  outreach here in CECS.

- I know that this document is a website; it's not using the official MS Word
  template. Mostly that's because this way I can make it readable on mobile,
  accessible (e.g. to screen readers for people with vision impairment), embed
  videos, make sure everyone's always reading the latest version, etc. But if
  you **really** need it as a `.docx` then I can convert it when it's finished 😊
