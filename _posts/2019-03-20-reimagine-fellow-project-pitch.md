Being a [Reimagine fellow]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}) requires having a
project, so here's my plan.

{% include toc.html %}

## Project Background and Description

### Elevator pitch

I want to start an extension/outreach program in creative code (using code to
make art + music & other cool things) for High School[^hs-college] students
interested in the intersection of art & technology. We will run workshops in
High Schools to identify interested students, and host a weekly interactive
learning community on-campus to give them opportunities to learn, create, and
share their skills. This program will attract fantastic students who might
otherwise not study Eng/CS at the ANU, and also engage the wider community in
helping them _reimagine_ what it is to be a Computer Scientist/Engineer in the
21st century.

[^hs-college]: since we're in the ACT, I mean Hign School + College; years 7--12

### Problems to be addressed

Interest in CS education is exploding at all educational levels, but there's an
acknowledged lack of support for students in schools which don't have specialist
teachers or an appropriate learning environment---especially for the "fun" stuff
which goes beyond textbook exercises. At the ANU we haven't done much to engage
at a pre-tertiary level (mostly because we're flat-out dealing with the huge
growth in students at a tertiary level). This program will address that.

In addition, CS still suffers from a stereotype of being for "nerdy white/asian
males", and those groups are certainly better represented in our undergraduate
CS cohort than other demographic groups. The Reimagine project "big tent" CS
education philosophy needs ways of attracting students who don't fit this
stereotype. In attracting students who are interested in using computers in the
arts & music this program can be _one part_ of that puzzle.

### Existing alternatives

Some ACT High Schools already have great non-traditional/creative CS/IT
programs, for example Dickson College, Radford College, Canberra (Boys) Grammar.
I plan to partner with these schools as [early adopters](#early-adopters).
However, even in these cases there's a missing link once students finish High
School---where can they go to further develop their creative practice? This
program will give them deep links & relationships into the ANU (across both CS
and the Schools of Art & Design and School of Music) and an avenue for
continuing their work in this area.

From the ANU side of things, one not-dissimilar example is the ANU School of
Music's [Open School of Music](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/open-school). From
their website:

> The aim of the Open School of Music is to provide developing musicians with a
> supportive and nurturing social environment in which they can improve their
> technical and theoretical knowledge of music, interact and share their love of
> music with their peers, and rub shoulders with the world of professional
> music-making.

> In particular, it aims to ensure that high-quality music education is
> accessible to all children in the ACT who have the interest and aptitude.

## Project Scope

### Solution proposed

### Value to organisation/Reimagine strategic alignment

### Target users

ACT High School & College students, as well as potentially students from the
wider Canberra region (since we could do a travelling version of the workshop).

### Early adopters {#early-adopters}

Maya and I have been discussing initial partner schools - apparently Dickson
College is keen for this sort of thing, and I've discussed it with the head of
IT from Boys Grammar, and also run similar workshops for Girls Grammar peeps in
the past as well.

## Deliverables

- **end 2019**: create a weekly curriculum (based on
  [COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)) with two streams (music &
  visuals)
  
after that, it's ongoing

## Consultation -- Project Sponsor and Stakeholders

Owner:
Consultations: Targets for consultation

## Success Metrics

Participation: how many students participate?

Retention: for the weekly on-campus classes, do students keep coming?

Creative outputs: we'll have an end-of-semester concert and gallery show---are
the things the students are making any good?

## Business Readiness

what needs to be in place to support the success of the project?

## Notes for draft readers

- It's currently a CS pitch---there's not much involvement from the Engineering
  schools at present, although this could change in the future. But I've decided
  to start with what I know.

- It's really hard to have all these stakeholder conversations while I'm on
  parental leave. So while I've discussed this sort of thing to varying degrees
  with everyone concerned (i.e. I'm sure no-one would be *shocked* to hear this
  project pitch) there's a chance that some of the details will change as I make
  things more concrete and sort out the details.

- This isn't exactly what I'd put in my [original pitch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
  _posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}), but from
  discussions in our workshop the other day I think this outreach project hits
  one of the main goals of the Reimagine project, and is really complementary to
  the other Fellows' projects.
