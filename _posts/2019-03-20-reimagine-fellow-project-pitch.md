Being a [Reimagine fellow]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}) requires having a
project, so here's my plan.

{% include toc.html %}

## Project Background and Description

### Elevator pitch

I want to start an extension/outreach program in creative code (using code to
make art + music & other cool things) for High School[^hs-college] students
interested in the intersection of art & technology. We will run workshops in
High Schools to identify interested students, and host **c/c/c
studio**[^ccc-group] a weekly on-campus interactive learning community to give
them opportunities to learn, create, and share their skills. This program will
produce exhibitions & performances of new works of code-based art & music,
attract fantastic students who might otherwise not study Eng/CS at the ANU, and
also engage the wider community in helping them _reimagine_ what it is to be a
Computer Scientist/Engineer in the 21st century.

[^hs-college]: since we're in the ACT, I mean Hign School _and_ College; years 7--12

[^ccc-group]:
    named after the
    [code/creativity/culture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
    (c/c/c) research group that I lead, which already has some sort of a name
    around the place and might be useful for "branding" this activity

### Problems to be addressed

Interest in CS education is exploding at all educational levels, but there's an
acknowledged lack of support for students in schools which don't have specialist
teachers or an appropriate learning environment---especially for the "fun" stuff
which goes beyond textbook exercises. At the ANU we haven't done much to engage
at a pre-tertiary level (mostly because we're flat-out dealing with the huge
growth in students at a tertiary level). This program will address that.

In addition, CS still suffers from a stereotype of being for "nerdy white/asian
males", and those groups are certainly better represented in our undergraduate
CS cohort than other demographic groups. The Reimagine project "big tent" CS
education philosophy needs ways of attracting students who don't fit this
stereotype. In attracting students who are interested in using computers in the
arts & music this program can be _one part_ of that puzzle.

### Existing alternatives

Some ACT High Schools already have great non-traditional/creative CS/IT
programs, for example Dickson College, Radford College, Canberra (Boys) Grammar.
I plan to partner with these schools as [early adopters](#early-adopters).
However, even in these cases there's a missing link once students finish High
School---where can they go to further develop their creative practice? This
program will give them deep links & relationships into the ANU (across both CS
and the Schools of Art & Design and School of Music) and an avenue for
continuing their work in this area.

There are a few outreach programs for schools [advertised on the CECS
website](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/more-information/outreach-programs-schools),
however the listed programs are dominated by Engineering rather than CS (9 vs 4
programs) and of the 4 CS programs I'm involved with 2 of them already. In
addition, these are all once-off workshops

In the wider ANU context, one similar program is the ANU School of Music's [Open
School of Music](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/open-school). From their website:

> The aim of the Open School of Music is to provide developing musicians with a
> supportive and nurturing social environment in which they can improve their
> technical and theoretical knowledge of music, interact and share their love of
> music with their peers, and rub shoulders with the world of professional
> music-making.

> In particular, it aims to ensure that high-quality music education is
> accessible to all children in the ACT who have the interest and aptitude.

Once a student makes it to CECS as a uni student, they can take my [COMP1720:
Art & Interaction in New Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) course
as an elective in either a CS degree or a Bachelor of Visual Arts. This course
has run successfully as a cross-disciplinary "learn to code" course for several
years. As the **A** in STEAM, the arts & creative domains provide an important
avenue for engaging students with coding and computer science, especially those
who might not normally engage with CS-type activities. This project will extend
this opportunity to High School students in the ACT.

## Project Scope

### Solution proposed

### Value to organisation/Reimagine strategic alignment

### Target users

ACT High School & College students, as well as students from the wider Canberra
region (since we could do a travelling version of the workshop).

### Early adopters {#early-adopters}

Maya and I have been discussing initial partner schools---apparently Dickson
College is keen for this sort of thing, and I've discussed it with the head of
IT from Boys Grammar, and also run similar workshops for Girls Grammar peeps in
the past as well.

## Deliverables {#deliverables}

This project will deliver:

- a **curriculum** (including instructor notes) for the weekly c/c/c studio
  sessions, which will be freely released to the public under a creative commons
  licence ([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))

- a biannual **gallery exhibition** and **multimedia music performance** held on
  campus (perhaps in the new cultural centre) as the capstone for each student's
  work in the c/c/c studio

## Project Sponsor and Stakeholders

- **Sponsor**: Nick?
- **Owner**: Ben Swift
- **Consultations**:
  - [Alec Hunter](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/hunter-at) (ANU
    SoM, previously the convenor of the Open School of Music program)

## Success Metrics

We will judge the success of this program using the following metrics, both in
absolute terms, and also trends over time.

- **Participation**: how many students participate?
- **Retention**: for the weekly c/c/c studio sessions, do students keep coming
  over time?
- **Creative outputs**: we'll have an end-of-semester concert and gallery
  show---are the things the students are making any good?
- **Curriculum uptake**: is the curriculum developed for the c/c/c studio
  sessions used by HS teachers to run similar groups in their schools?

## Business Readiness

### Physical space requirements

A room with one computer per student (either a lab machine or personal laptop)
which can run a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). No other set-up
required (all content & coding is done in-browser). In addition, some sound gear
will be required for the students interested in making music---headphones &
a small mixing desk (I have some of this gear already).

### Enrollment/admin requirements

We will require public liability insurance for any students who come onto campus for the c/c/c
studio sessions.

It would be great to be able to give students who complete the c/c/c studio
program (which will be held in semester-long increments) an official ANU
certificate of completion.

Longer-term, it'd be really great to have the ability to give participants in
the c/c/c studio program credit into our first-year CS program (e.g.
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)) if they decide to come and
study in CECS. This is the same as the equivalent [Discovering Engineering
extension program](http://extension.anu.edu.au/study/discovering-engineering),
which gives students credit for the first-year

## Notes for draft readers

- It's currently a CS pitch---there's not much involvement from the Engineering
  schools at present, although this could change in the future. But I've decided
  to start with what I know.

- It's really hard to have all these stakeholder conversations while I'm on
  parental leave. So while I've discussed this sort of thing to varying degrees
  with everyone concerned (i.e. I'm sure no-one would be *shocked* to hear this
  project pitch) there's a chance that some of the details will change as I make
  things more concrete and sort out the details.

- This isn't exactly what I'd put in my [original pitch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
  _posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}), but from
  discussions in our workshop the other day I think this outreach project hits
  one of the main goals of the Reimagine project, and is really complementary to
  the other Fellows' projects.

- Some of the nomenclature is still TBC, e.g. code vs tech, arts vs art/music vs
  creativity, etc. Part of the initial phase of the project will be workshopping
  these terms to see which ones best resonate with the potential audiences, and
  also which best capture what _actually_ goes on.

- I'm not sure about the [RAPID](#rapid-analysis) part, I'm open to suggestions
  on what that section might mean in the context of this project.
