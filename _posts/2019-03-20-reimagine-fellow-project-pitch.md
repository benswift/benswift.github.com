## Project Background and Description

### Elevator pitch

{:.hl-para}

I want to start the **c/c/c studio**[^ccc-group], an extension/outreach program
in creative code (using code to make art + music & other cool things) for ACT
High School[^hs-college] students interested in the intersection of art &
technology. Students will be part of a weekly on-campus interactive learning
community where they will be guided by instructors in creating their own new
works of code-based art & music. At the end of each semester we will host a
"grad show" gallery exhibition/performance of the works from the c/c/c studio.
This program will attract fantastic students who might otherwise not study
Engineering or Computer Science (either at ANU or elsewhere) and engage the
wider community in helping them _reimagine_ what it is to be a Computer
Scientist or Engineer in the 21st century.

[^hs-college]: since we're in the ACT, I mean Hign School _and_ College (i.e. years 7--12)

[^ccc-group]:
    named after the
    [code/creativity/culture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/)
    (c/c/c) research group that I lead, which already has some name recognition
    around the place and will be useful for "branding" this activity

### Problems to be addressed

Interest in Computer Science (CS) education is exploding at all educational
levels, but there's a lack of support for students in schools which don't have
specialist teachers or an appropriate learning environment---especially for the
"fun" stuff which goes beyond textbook exercises. At the ANU we haven't done
very much to engage at a pre-tertiary level, mostly because we're flat-out
dealing with the huge growth in students at a tertiary level. The c/c/c studio
program will address that.

In addition, CS still suffers from a stereotype of being for "nerdy white/asian
males", and those groups are certainly over-represented in our undergraduate CS
cohort compared to other groups. The Reimagine "big tent" CS education
philosophy needs ways of attracting students who don't fit the usual CS
stereotypes. In attracting & nurturing students who are interested in using
computers in the arts & music the c/c/c studio can be _one part_ of that bigger
mission.

Undergraduate students at the ANU can take my [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in
New Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) course as part of a major in
either a CS degree or a Bachelor of Visual Arts (or indeed as a cross-campus
elective in any program). COMP1720 has run successfully as a cross-disciplinary
"learn to code" course for several years. As the **A** in STEAM, the arts
provide an important avenue for engaging students with coding and computer
science, especially those who might not normally engage with CS-type activities.
The c/c/c studio will extend this opportunity to High School students in the
ACT.

### Existing alternatives

Some ACT High Schools already have great non-traditional/creative CS/IT programs
(I plan to partner with teachers at these schools as [early
adopters](#early-adopters)). However, even in these cases there's a missing link
once students finish High School---where can they go to further develop their
creative practice? The c/c/c studio program will give them deep links &
relationships into the ANU (across both CS and the Schools of Art & Design and
School of Music) and an avenue for continuing their work in this area.

There are a few outreach programs [advertised on the CECS
website](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/more-information/outreach-programs-schools),
however the listed programs are dominated by Engineering rather than CS (9 vs 4
programs) and of the 4 CS programs I'm involved with 2 of them already. There's
also the official [ANU Extension](http://extension.anu.edu.au) scheme for Year
11 & 12 students in the ACT, however CS doesn't yet participate in this scheme.

In the wider ANU context, one similar program is the ANU School of Music's [Open
School of Music](http://music.cass.anu.edu.au/open-school). From their website:

> The aim of the Open School of Music is to provide developing musicians with a
> supportive and nurturing social environment in which they can improve their
> technical and theoretical knowledge of music, interact and share their love of
> music with their peers, and rub shoulders with the world of professional
> music-making. In particular, it aims to ensure that high-quality music
> education is accessible to all children in the ACT who have the interest and
> aptitude.

In 2018 I ran the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/projects/laptop-ensemble/),
which attempted to provide a similar open-ended space for creative exploration
to the c/c/c studio, but for undergraduate students. I will be drawing on all of
these connections & influences in developing the c/c/c studio program during my
Reimagine Fellowship.

## Project Scope

### Solution proposed

The weekly c/c/c studio sessions won't be lectures, or even tutorials---they
will adopt a [studio-based
learning](https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/assessing-studio-based-learning) model,
with each student working on their own code-based music or visual artwork as a
semester-long creative "work". The [Studio Teaching
Project](http://www.studioteaching.org) (a research collaboration between UNSW,
UQ, RMIT and UTas) has released some helpful material for employing this
teaching model, which we will make use of in developing the c/c/c curriculum.

The first part of this project (mid-2019 to end 2019) is to figure out the
details of the c/c/c studio sessions, but here are some initial plans:

- students will apply to participate based on interest and aptitude, so we can
  assume that students are engaged and willing to be self-directed in their
  learning
- the weekly c/c/c studio session will be 2hrs long, held at an (or more,
  depending on numbers) after-school-friendly timeslot
- students will commit to attending for a semester, culminating in a public grad
  show exhibition/performance at the end of the semester
- each session will be small---max 20 students with 1 instructor (Ben) and one
  tutor
- students will be able to select either a music or visual art emphasis in their
  projects, with sub-communities for each
- students will participate in collaborative "studio crit" sessions to work
  share ideas and stretch one another in their work
- initial "training" material be adapted from the [COMP1720 lab
  material](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/labs/) and tweaked as
  appropriate
- students will be exposed to regular guest "provocations" from students and
  creative researchers from CECS, the ANU School of Art & Design, ANU School of
  Music, ANU Centre for Digital Humanities Research, etc.
- as well as me (Ben) guiding the students, we will employ one of our
  undergraduate students as a tutor for these sessions

In addition to the weekly c/c/c studio sessions, we will also run (less
frequent) workshops in the High Schools themselves. These workshops will be used
to recruit/excite students with the interest and aptitude to attend the c/c/c
studio program, to share knowledge and open minds to the sorts of things which
are possible with computers and programming, and to strengthen the pathways
between the IT programs in ACT High Schools into our CECS undergraduate
programs.

### Value to organisation/Reimagine strategic alignment

From the [Reimagine Project page](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine):

> We will inspire a new generation of high-potential, creative people to come to
> engineering and computing with a diverse range of interests, motivations,
> perspectives and career aspirations.

This "new generation" will not be won over by glossy brochures and fancy new
buildings---they will come because they can see concrete ways in which their
diverse range of interests can be harnessed and _put to work_ to do amazing
things. The c/c/c studio will provide a supportive community in which this new
generation can learn, create, and share. More than that, it will unlock the
latent potential in students who never knew their diverse interests (especially
in the arts & music) _could_ be used in engineering and computing.

The c/c/c studio is also an "outwardly-focused education program" (taken from
the _Reimagine Fellow_ position description) which builds two-way relationships
with ACT High Schools. The end-of-semester grad shows provide an opportunity to
showcase the innovative education & creative-practice going on in the c/c/c
studio (and CECS more broadly) and in doing so to make an impact in the ANU and
wider Canberra community.

Finally, the c/c/c studio presents an opportunity as an "object lesson" for the
breadth of places that an Engineering/Computer Science skillset can be
applied---a crucial part of Reimagining CECS from a problem-solving to
problem-_finding_ institution.

### Target users

ACT High School & College students, as well as students from the wider Canberra
region (since we could do a travelling version of the workshop).

Also, teachers from these schools will be encouraged to partner with us in both
supporting their students to participate in the c/c/c studio, and also to
incorporate creative arts & code activities in their classrooms in general (e.g.
using the c/c/c studio curriculum, which will be made freely available).

### Early adopters {#early-adopters}

I will build on my (and others) existing relationships with teachers from
[Dickson College](http://www.dicksonc.act.edu.au), [Radford
College](https://www.radford.act.edu.au), [Lyneham
High](http://lynehamhs.act.edu.au), [Canberra (Boys)
Grammar](https://cgs.act.edu.au) and [Canberra Girls
Grammar](https://www.cggs.act.edu.au). These schools, with their existing groups
of students interested in creative code, can give early feedback and serve as
"seed" populations for the first semester of c/c/c studio sessions in S1 2020.

## Deliverables {#deliverables}

This project will deliver:

- a **curriculum** (including instructor notes) for the weekly c/c/c studio
  sessions, which will be freely released to the public under a creative commons
  licence ([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))

- a biannual **c/c/c studio grad show** gallery exhibition and music performance
  held on campus (perhaps in the new cultural centre) as the capstone for each
  semester's student work in the c/c/c studio

- (TBC) [RSCS's](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) first ANU
  Extension program
  
There'll be lots of other stuff, too: building a community of practice,
deepening ANU CS/CECS's relationships with ACT High Schools, giving our
undergraduate students a chance to mentor these high school students, etc. But
that's intangible stuff, so I'm not sure if they count as a deliverables.

## Success Metrics

We will judge the success of this program using the following metrics, both in
absolute terms and also trends over time.

- **Participation**: how many students participate?
- **Retention**: for the weekly c/c/c studio sessions, do students keep coming
  over time?
- **Creative outputs**: we'll have an end-of-semester concert and gallery
  show---are the things the students are making any good?
- **Curriculum uptake**: is the curriculum developed for the c/c/c studio
  sessions used by HS teachers to run similar groups in their schools?

## Business Readiness

### Physical space requirements

The c/c/c studio will require a room for one 2-3 hour session every week in an
after-school friendly timeslot (perhaps 4pm-6pm). This room needs to have one
computer per student (either a lab machine or personal laptop) which can run a
modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). One of our computer labs in
Building #145 should do the job initially.

In addition, some sound gear may be required for the students interested in
making music, e.g. headphones & a small mixing desk (I have some of this gear
already).

### Enrolment/admin requirements

In the short term, it would be great to be able to give students who complete
the c/c/c studio program (which will be held in semester-long increments) an
official ANU certificate of completion.

Longer-term, it'd be really great to have the ability to give participants in
the c/c/c studio program credit into our first-year CS program (e.g.
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)) if they decide to come and
study in CECS. This is the same as the equivalent [Discovering Engineering
extension program](http://extension.anu.edu.au/study/discovering-engineering),
which (I _think_) gives students credit for a first-year ENGN course if they
study Engineering at the ANU.

We will require public liability insurance for any students who come onto campus
for the c/c/c studio sessions .

## Cost/Time Commitments

**Ben**: 2 days/week (40% FTE) for 2.5 years (mid 2019-end 2021). This includes:

1. developing the curriculum
2. building relationships with High Schools and recruiting students
3. delivering the weekly c/c/c studio session(s)
4. running workshops in High Schools (~monthly)

**Tutors**: depending on how many students attend, we will need to employ one
(or more) of our undergraduate students to help support the students in the
c/c/c studio.

**Equipment**: music gear (~2k) so that students can connect their laptops to
play _together_

**Grad show budget**: (~1k per semester from 2020) for venue/equipment hire
(e.g. PA, fancy projectors, etc.)

**Estimated project costs**: TBD

## Notes for draft readers

- It's currently a CS pitch---there's not much involvement from the Engineering
  schools at present, although this could change in the future. But I've decided
  to start with what I know.

- Looking at the [Risks](#risks) section, a lot of it's on my shoulders---need
  to fix that.

- The project proposal part isn't super detailed, and that's mostly because I
  need to do some research (discussions with HS teachers, read literature &
  examine similar programs elsewhere) in the first 6months (mid-late 2019) to
  figure out those details.

- This isn't exactly what I'd put in my [original pitch]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
  _posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}), but from
  discussions in our workshop the other day I think this outreach project hits
  one of the main goals of the Reimagine project, and is really complementary to
  the other Fellows' projects.

- Some of the nomenclature is still TBC, e.g. the whole "c/c/c studio" thing,
  code vs tech, art vs music vs creativity, etc. Part of the initial phase of
  the project will be workshopping these terms to see which ones best resonate
  with the potential audiences, and also which best capture what _actually_ goes
  on.

- I'm not sure about the [RAPID](#rapid-analysis) part, I'm open to suggestions
  on what that section might mean in the context of this project.

- It's really hard to have all the necessary stakeholder conversations while I'm
  on parental leave. So while I've discussed this sort of thing to varying
  degrees with everyone concerned (i.e. I'm sure no-one would be *shocked* to
  hear this project pitch) there's a chance that some of the details will change
  as I make things more concrete and sort out the details.
