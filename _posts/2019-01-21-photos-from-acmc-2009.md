Wow, this was a blast from the past. Here are a few photos of me from the 2009
Australasian Computer Music Conference in Queensland, Australia. Here's me
giving my research talk, entitled *Distributed Performance in Livecoding*.

And here's my livecoding set later in the night (the main event---the research
talk was just a talk about the infrastructure I was using in this set).

The cool thing about this gig was that I'd written a companion iPhone app, so
that I could choose certain parameters & program structures in my code, and push
them out to audience members (on the fly) so that they could take over
controlling those parameters. Here's a shot of folks hopefully enjoing the set:

Sadly, no video recordings survived from this gig. Just as well, actually,
because I had a resource leak in my networking code which ended up making the
whole system unresponsive after about 10mins of performing. I remember furiously
trying to debug it on-the-fly (the music was still playing, but I couldn't
change anything) but I don't think I managed to salvage it very gracefully. Ah,
livecoding---a good learning experience for sure.

Many thanks to [Andrew Brown](https://twitter.com/algomusic) for (1) taking
these photos and (2) keeping the album online after all these years.[^ab]

    AB, if you're reading this, I know that you put the photos online under an

    hopefully you don't mind me keeping them here for posterity.
