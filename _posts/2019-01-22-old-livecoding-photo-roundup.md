I'm trying to find all the photos of me doing livecoding gigs over the past 10
years. If you've got an old photo of me doing my thing, then can you either
[email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/benswift) at
me to share it? I'll give you authoreal credit and hugs.

For any photos of actual gigs, they'll go into the
[livecoding]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.md %}) section of this website.
However, I also do lots of other presentations, talks and demos which don't
really count as "gigs". For those, I'll just add the photos here as they turn
up.

This isn't me *performing*, unless you count my animated conversation with
Gordon Monro as a performance.
