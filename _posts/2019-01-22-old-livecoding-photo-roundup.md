Inspired by [yesterday's post]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-01-21-photos-from-acmc-2009.md %}), I'm trying to find all the
photos of me doing livecoding gigs over the past 10 years. If you've got an old
photo of me doing my thing, then can you either
[email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/benswift) at
me to share it? I'll give you authoreal credit and hugs.

Ok, here are the ones I've got so far:

### Australian Council of Deans of ICT 2017

### Australasian Computer Music Conference (ACMC) 2007

This isn't me *performing*, unless you count my animated conversation with
Gordon Monro as a performance.
