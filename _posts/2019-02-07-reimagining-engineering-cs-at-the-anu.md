title: Reimagining Engineering & CS at the ANU

---

The [ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au)
(CECS) is being *Reimagined*. Don't take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader [Elanor](https://cecs.anu.edu.au):

{% include slides/youtube.html id="FjlgEZzaL6k" aspect="56.25%" %}

Basically, this [Reimagine project](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) is a
*huge* investment from the ANU for Engineering & Computer Science (CECS) to
grow, change, and to skate to where the puck is going to be in 2050
(technologically, societally, culturally, and more).

The search is on within CECS to identify **Reimagine Fellows** to champion
various parts of this transformation. This is super-exciting, especially for
interdisciplinary art/design/technology folks (like me). It'd be exciting if it
was happening *anywhere*, but it's particularly exciting that it's happening
where I am and that I might get a voice in shaping exactly what a "reimagined
CECS" looks like.

{:.hl-para}

Elanor, if you're reading, I want to be a Reimagine Fellow. And since the
[EoI](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest)
asked for "1000 words **in any format you like**", my EoI takes the form of an
FAQ[^faq].

[^faq]: At least it's not a haiku. Or a limerick.

## Ben's Reimagine Fellow Application FAQ

### In one sentence, why do you want to be a Reimagine Fellow?

I want to see more art[^art] in CECS; both in what we do and in the way we do
it.

*Note*: defining "art" is beyond the scope of this blog post, obviously. But I
don't just mean it in the narrow "high/fine art" sense, although I don't mean it
in the "all the humanities" sense either. Think making music, drawing pictures,
writing stories---but with an element of technology in the mix.
	
### What does that have to do with the Reimagine Project?

> *The role of an artist is to ask questions, not to answer them* -**Anton
> Chekhov**

As Elanor says in the video above, we don't even know what tomorrow's problems
are yet; so we need problem *finders*, not just problem *solvers*. Art/artists
have a key role to play in this (just ask Chekov).

### Why are you the best person to do this?

I've made a career (so far) of deploying my technical/CS skills to artistic
ends: in my livecoding (both building
[tools](https://github.com/digego/extempore) and [doing live
gigs]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.html %})), in starting the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/projects/laptop-ensemble/),
in teaching our first-year art+code course
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/).

Along the way I've built strong networks in these areas, across the ANU campus
and in the wider community, and I've always said that I was keen to engage with
them more deeply---this is my chance.

### So you're just trying to score a grant to go off and do your own weird art thing?

Absolutely not. Look, I'm actually kindof insecure about my own artistic
practice---I think deep down many interdisciplinary artist/technologists are. We
always feel like we're not doing 

Being a Reimagine Fellow isn't about doing something by yourself---it's way too
big a project for that to be of any use. It's about weaving that thing into the
whole College[^dna], so that by 2050 it affects the way *everyone* thinks.

[^dna]:
    You could even say "weaving it into the College's DNA". But that'd be dumb.
    Institutions don't have DNA---ask any biologist.

### How does this further the broader goals of the Reimagine Project...

#### in research

Artists have always been at the vanguard of building new things (or seeing/using
old things in new ways). If an artist has an idea in her head for what she wants
to create, but the tools to realise it don't exist yet, that artist is
*intrinsically* motivated to figure out how to make it happen.

I also want to be clear that my pitch here isn't to see the arts as a technical
problem that needs to be solved by engineers and computer scientists; "hey
artists, thanks for the last few thousand years, we'll take it from here". We've
already got too much technochauvinism in tech. But that a newly-Reimagined CECS
can *include* artists in shaping what the computer scientists and engineers of
2050 look like, so that it's *not* an "us and them".

Finally, there are top research institutions asking real questions in the fields
of creative technology, digital art, music and design: have a look at [the list
below](#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening).

#### in education

Again, that Chekov quote above really nails it. For some students being asked to
make something creative/artistic is what it takes to flick the switch to go
beyond the "what boxes do I need to tick for me to get a P/CR/D/HD" mindset to
actually asking the right questions. I see this sometimes in
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/), and it's one of the most
enjoyable things about teaching that course.

The other thing I want to see is more of the dreamers, doodlers and
"creatives"[^creatives] study engineering or CS at uni. Too often they feel like
they have to choose between "pursuing the dream" or selling out and studying
something boring & pragmatic. I fear that we (CECS) misses out on some
*brilliant* students because of this. I want them to know that they can
absolutely do both, and in doing so they'll be doing top-class
engineering/CS/design work.

[^creatives]:
    Although I reject the Romantic notion that "creatives" are some sort of
    rarified "other", conduits to some deep wellspring of hidden creative mojo
    from the other side. We're all just humans, constructing and engaging in
    cultural practices with this stuff, building on what went before.

#### in outreach

Because of my [livecoding]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.html %}) I get
asked to do outreach stuff all the time (you're welcome, CECS marketing team
ðŸ˜‰). I know why I get asked: DJing with code is so different, and it's a great
hook for engaging folks who might not have thought that combining code & musical
creativity in that way was possible.

Also, while I want to "grow the pie" in CECS, arts+technology wise for mostly
high-minded and noble reasons, there's a tiny bit of "the more livecoders we
have, the more we'll be able to spread the load in our outreach activities" in
there as well.

#### in culture

The Reimagine Project isn't just about doing the same things with a different
org-chart. It's about changing the culture of Engineering & Computing research
and practice. While the stereotypes about nerdy engineers and computer types
isn't necessarily fair in my experience, there's no smoke without a fire, and
there *are* some things we need to do better. Incorporating creative expression
deep within our education, research and outreach work will change the way we
communicate with the outside world, but it'll also change the sorts of people we
attract, and welcoming new perspectives into CECS is another way we can enact
cultural change.

### Isn't this treading on the toes of the School of Art & Design (and the School of Music, and ...)?

No---in fact we need to work with our colleagues in those places to make this
stuff happen. I already co-supervise PhD students with
[Mitchell](https://twitter.com/mtchl), [Geoff](https://twitter.com/gravitron)
from the School or Art & Design and [Terhi](https://twitter.com/tmtn) from the
Centre for Digital Humanities Research, and I run the ANU Laptop Ensemble with
[Alec](https://twitter.com/huntercomposer) from the School of Music. And I want
to see *more* of this type of cross-supervision across these parts of campus.

Actually, this "treading on toes" question looms over the whole Reimagine
Project. I think the best way forward is to partner with the other parts of
campus to bring their expertise and smoosh it together with ours.

Concretely, that means:
- sending CECS coursework students to take courses in other parts of campus (as
  part of majors/minors/electives, etc.) as well as the other way around
- co-employing academics across Colleges in joint positions
- increasing our to participation in the ANU's interdisciplinary HDR programs
  like [ICCR](http://rsha.cass.anu.edu.au/students/future/iccr)

### This is all kindof abstract---what might this look like concretely?

The Reimagine Project is [big, hairy, and
audacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal), so it's
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like:

#### In the short term...

- a CECS-supported "Reimagine residency" (starting asap!) to support artists to
  get involved and help us figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks like

- a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
  where students take courses from within CECS, the [ANU School of Art &
  Design](http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au), and the ANU School of Music

- new courses within CECS on e.g. algorithmic music composition, creative
  making, AI/Deep Learning Art, subversive computing/[designing for
  evil](https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/21/designed-for-evil/)[^genevieve]
  
- more PhD students doing practice-led research on interdisciplinary
  art/CS/engineering projects

[^genevieve]: I'd love to get [Genevieve](https://twitter.com/feraldata) to write & teach that one.

#### In the medium/long term

- a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
  and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the [College of Arts & Social
  Sciences](http://cass.anu.edu.au))
  
- a thoroughly non-traditional project-based "creative tech" masters program,
  with no classes, no heirarchies, just a bunch of brilliant students set loose
  with duct tape, GPUs, a giant bag of sensors & actuators, soldering irons, oh
  my. (Geoff Hinchcliffe and I have discussed this---we're both thrilled and
  terrified at the prospect. And I love what the
  [3AI](https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/#apply) master's program is shaping
  up to be, and am keen to be a part of it.)

### Where in the world is this already happening? {#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening}

Here's a selection (but there are others), including what each place says about
their goals (from the marketing copy on their own website). Many (but not all)
of these labs/groups are in CS/Engineering Schools, or at least in design
schools (which tend to be all over the place, org-chart wise).

### Has the ANU ever had anything like this before?

Sure, for example [this](http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/), and it was
amazing. The story about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I've only
really ever heard it second/third-hand, and I'm not proposing to resurrect ACAT
as part of the Reimagine Project. But it's important to know one's history.

<!-- ### Where might this fit in CECS, in the long-term? -->

<!-- You mean which School within CECS (i.e. CS, Design, AeroMech&Env or -->
<!-- ElecEnerMat)? That's a good question---I don't really know for sure. The content -->
<!-- is going to cross over a few of them,  -->

<!-- Further, who says it needs to be *in* CECS at all? -->

<!-- Anyway, these are problems which we'll only be really able to answer once we -->
<!-- have more vibrant creative technology stuff going on, and also as the broader -->
<!-- Reimagine Project takes shape. -->

### Sounds like a huge job, Ben---how are you going to manage it?

Only by building up our capacity in these areas. [Charles
Martin](https://twitter.com/cpmpercussion) is just about to start as a new
Lecturer in RSCS, and he's a computer musician (apps and ML for group musical
improvisation).

### You seem to have strong opinions about this stuff, what if it doesn't fit with the way the rest of the Reimagine Project shakes out?

Look, obviously I know that this is all fluid---and I don't really know exactly
how even some of my ideas here will work out in practice.


### Do you really get asked these questions *frequently*, Ben?

No.

### How many words is this post?

It's {{ page.content | number_of_words }} words (which I realise is {{
page.content | number_of_words | minus: 1000 }} over the limit, but it includes
all the quotes from the other institutions and the selection criteria, so I
figure it's ok overall).
