The [ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au)
(CECS) is being *Reimagined*. Don't take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader [Dean Elanor](https://cecs.anu.edu.au): her:

{% include slides/youtube.html id="FjlgEZzaL6k" aspect="56.25%" %}

Basically, this [Reimagine project](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) is a
*huge* investment from the ANU for Engingeering & Computer Science (CECS) to
grow, change, and to skate to where the puck is heading (technologically,
societally, culturally, etc).

This is super-exciting, especially for interdisciplinary art/design/technology
practitioners (like me). This would be exciting if it was happening *anywhere*,
but it's particularly exciting that it's happening where I am and that I get a
voice in shaping exactly what a "reimagined CECS" looks like. In fact, the
search is on within CECS to identify **Reimagine Fellows** to champion various
parts of the transformation.

From the
[EoI](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest),
the specific duties of a Reimagine Fellow include:

> - Champion change and transformation within the College
> - Support the establishment of innovative, interdisciplinary, outwardly-focused
>   research and education programs;
> - Support the development of partnerships with industry and engage with the
>   wider research community to embed progressive engineering and computing
>   research capabilities;
> - Contribute to the strategic priorities of research within the College and its
>   schools and institutes,;
> - Support the development of transformative experiences for students and the
>   next generation of graduate researchers.

Elanor, if you're reading, **I want to be one of those Reimagine Fellows**. And
since the
[EoI](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest)
asked for "1000 words in any format you like", here's my {{ page.content |
number_of_words }}-word pitch.

## The pitch

To strengthen connections between CECS and the SoAD, SoM, DH by

new courses

more PhD students

more events


## What's already happening

## Where in the world is this being done well?

Here's a selection (but there are others), including what each place says about
their goals in their own marketing copy.

> The [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) is an interdisciplinary
> research lab that encourages the unconventional mixing and matching of
> seemingly disparate research areas.

> The [Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative
> Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org) at Carnegie Mellon University is
> a laboratory for atypical, anti-disciplinary, and inter-institutional research
> at the intersections of arts, science, technology and culture.

> [SensiLab](https://sensilab.monash.edu) is a technology-driven, design-focused
> research lab based at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

> NYU's [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) (Interactive Telecommunications
> Program) is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the
> Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative use of communications
> technologies.

> The [Centre for Digital Music (c4dm)](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at Queen
> Mary University of London is a world-leading multidisciplinary research group
> in the field of Music & Audio Technology.

> The [Embodied AudioVisual Interaction
> (EAVI)](http://eavi.goldsmithsdigital.com) group at Goldsmiths is a research
> group focused on embodied interaction with sound and image.

> The Stanford [Center for Computer Research in Music and
> Acoustics]((https://ccrma.stanford.edu)) (CCRMA) is a multi-disciplinary
> facility where composers and researchers work together using computer-based
> technology both as an artistic medium and as a research tool.

## Why do this?

not a profit motive. that sucks.

am I committed to the c/c/c branding? not 100% sure.

## What might this look like?

{% asset images/posts/bhag.jpg @pic alt="Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals" %}

This Reimagination goal is [big, hairy, and
audacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal), so it's
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like:

### In the short term...

- a CECS-supported "Reimagine residency" supporting artists to get involved and
  create things while we figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks like

- a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
  with courses from within CECS, the [ANU School of Art &
  Design](http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au), and the ANU School of Music

### In the medium/long term

- a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
  and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the [College of Arts & Social
  Sciences](http://cass.anu.edu.au))

## Footnotes, etc.

We actually had [something like this in the
past](http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/), and it was amazing. The story
about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I've only really ever heard it
second/third-hand. But it's worth pointing out that we have
