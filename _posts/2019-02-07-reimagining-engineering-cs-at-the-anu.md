The [ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au)
(CECS) is being *Reimagined*. Don't take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader [Elanor](https://cecs.anu.edu.au):

{% include slides/youtube.html id="FjlgEZzaL6k" aspect="56.25%" %}

Basically, this [Reimagine project](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) is a
*huge* investment from the ANU for Engineering & Computer Science (CECS) to
grow, change, and to skate to where the puck is going to be in 2050
(technologically, societally, culturally, and more).

The search is on within CECS to identify **Reimagine Fellows** to champion
various parts of this transformation. This is super-exciting, especially for
interdisciplinary art/design/technology folks (like me). It'd be exciting if it
was happening *anywhere*, but it's particularly exciting that it's happening
where I am and that I might get a voice in shaping exactly what a "reimagined
CECS" looks like.

{:.hl-para}

Elanor, if you're reading, I want to be a Reimagine Fellow. And since the
[EoI](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest)
asked for "1000 words **in any format you like**", my EoI takes the form of an
FAQ[^faq].

[^faq]: At least it's not a haiku. Or a limerick.

## FAQ

### What's your vision for your contribution as a *Reimagine Fellow*?

I've made a career (so far) of applying my CS skills to artistic ends: in my
[livecoding]({{site.baseurl}}{% link livecoding.html %}) (both building
[tools](https://github.com/digego/extempore) and doing live gigs), in starting
the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/projects/laptop-ensemble/),
in teaching our [first-year art+code course
COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/).

### What does that have to do with the Reimagine Project?

> *The role of an artist is to ask questions, not to answer them* -**Anton
> Chekhov**

As Elanor says in the video above, we don't even know what tomorrow's problems
are yet; so we need problem *finders*, not just problem *solvers*. Art/artists
can play a key role as "organisational irritants"; challenging the status quo,
being flies in the ointment, and `ERROR: CLICHE NOT FOUND`.

### How does this further the broader *teaching* goals of the Reimagine Project?

### How does this further the broader *research* goals of the Reimagine Project?

### Isn't this treading on the toes of the School of Art & Design (and the School of Music, and ...)?

No---in fact I plan to work with my colleagues in those places to make this
stuff happen. I already co-supervise PhD students with
[Mitchell](https://twitter.com/mtchl), [Geoff](https://twitter.com/gravitron)
and Terhi [Terhi](https://twitter.com/tmtn), and we *need*

This question looms over the whole Reimagine Project, really. But I think the
best way forward is to partner with the other parts of campus to bring their
expertise and smoosh it together with ours.

Concretely, that means:
- sending *our* students to study *their* courses (as part of
  majors/minors/electives, etc.) as well as the other way around
- co-employing academics in joint positions

### What are the specific duties of a *Reimagine Fellow*?

1. Champion change and transformation within the College
2. Support the establishment of innovative, interdisciplinary, outwardly-focused
   research and education programs;
3. Support the development of partnerships with industry and engage with the
   wider research community to embed progressive engineering and computing
   research capabilities;
4. Contribute to the strategic priorities of research within the College and its
   schools and institutes,;
5. Support the development of transformative experiences for students and the
   next generation of graduate researchers.

### What are the selection criteria?

1. Ability to demonstrate that the applicant can and will strategically
   complement and contribute to the activities and strategic priorities of the
   Reimagine project, including articulating a clear vision of their
   contribution to the broader agenda, in either or both an academic or
   professional capacity.
2. Demonstrated ability to make exceptional things within a broader agenda and
   in a team context, relative to opportunity
3. Excellent oral and written English or other language skills and a
   demonstrated ability to communicate and interact effectively with a variety
   of staff and students in a complex, interdisciplinary environment and to
   foster respectful, productive and inclusive working relationships with staff,
   students and colleagues at all levels.
4. A proven capacity to achieve against the selection principles outlined below
5. Demonstrated the personal attributes outlined below

### Why do this?

not a profit motive. that sucks.

am I committed to the c/c/c branding? not 100% sure.

### What might this look like?

{% asset images/posts/bhag.jpg @pic alt="Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals" %}

This project is [big, hairy, and
audacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal), so it's
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like:

#### In the short term...

- a CECS-supported "Reimagine residency" supporting artists to get involved and
  create things as part of helping us figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks
  like

- a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
  with courses from within CECS, the [ANU School of Art &
  Design](http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au), and the ANU School of Music

#### In the medium/long term

- a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
  and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the [College of Arts & Social
  Sciences](http://cass.anu.edu.au))

### Has the ANU ever had anything like this before?

Sure, for example [this](http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/), and it was
amazing. The story about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I've only
really ever heard it second/third-hand, and I'm not proposing to resurrect ACAT
as part of the Reimagine Project. But it's important to know one's history.

### Do you really get asked these questions *frequently*, Ben?

No.

### How many words is this post?

It's {{ page.content | number_of_words }} words.
