If you're in Canberra this Thursday Jan 30 then you should come to a (free) gig
that the c/c/c studio is putting on. Get away from the (heartbreaking)
[fires](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6600587/namadgi-fire-now-at-2575ha-total-fire-ban-declared/)
and come see us jam with special guest [Fi Sullivan](https://www.fisounds.com)
(US). Details from the [FB event
page](https://www.facebook.com/events/541225126490467/):

> Experimental sounds of processed voice, live coding, and neural networks for
> your early evening with musicians from the ANU Code/Creativity/Culture studio
> and special guest Fiona Sullivan (USA).

Kieran with be livecoding visuals in GLSL, Charles will be (very musically!)
fighting with his AI, I'll be dropping beats in Extempore and Fi will be
_amazing_. See you there.
