**If** you're a current ANU undergrad or coursework-postgrad student (*any* ANU
student, not just CS) who:

1. likes making **live** music/visuals on your laptop (e.g. if you're into, or
   would like to to get into [livecoding](https://vimeo.com/benswift/videos) or
   live VJing)

2. *or* likes organising, managing and promoting those sorts of gigs and bands
   (because even laptop orchestras need agents)

3. wants to get together with like (and unlike!)-minded folks and play some gigs
   **for university credit**

4. has 12 credit points (that's two courses) of room in your ANU degree for
   doing a [TechLauncher](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) project in S2
   2018 and S1 2019

**then** you need to get in touch with me (<ben.swift@anu.edu.au>), perhaps with
a link to some of your creative work, and we can try and make this happen.

I'm putting together a [Laptop
Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop_orchestra) (or, alternately an
[Algorave](https://algorave.com/) group) as a
[TechLauncher](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) project. Don't wait till the
start of semester 2; the groups might be full up by then!

Even if you're not sure if you're the right person (e.g. you're not sure how to
fit it into your degree program) if you've always liked technology, creativity
and live performance but never found the right outlet for those passions, then
[get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au), there might be ways to make it
happen.
