title: On parental leave and auto-reply messages

I'm now (as of the date of this blog post) on parental leave ([thanks,
Brian](http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/anu-announces-major-expansion-of-parental-leave)
ðŸ˜Š). I'm about to set up an email auto-reply which will guard my work email
address until 15 July.

But what should the auto-reply message say? I don't want to be super-long,
because no-one reads auto-reply messages. They just scan for the crucial
information (when is said person back) and then move on. So what I'm going to do
is leave a short auto-reply message, and then refer those interested to this
blog post for more info (in fact, that may well be how you got here).

**Here's the deal**: I'm away for a long time, and when I get back in July I'm going
to delete all the unread emails in my inbox. Sorry if that seems harsh, but it's
the only way to deal with this situation and have some chance of enjoying one's
return to work.

- If you've got important information which needs to be actioned *before* July
  15, then you need to make alternative arrangements. I wish you all the best
  with them, but I can't help you out with making it happen.

- If you've got important information which has an expiry date *after* July 15,
  then put a note in your calendar to re-email me after that date (because your
  email still won't survive the purge, sorry).

- If you need to get in touch urgently, then you probably have my personal email
  or phone number---feel free to give those a go.

Anyway, I'm gonna go be a Dad for a while, and *try* to switch off about
research & work stuff. I'll still read the odd book, and maybe even make some
more music, but most of the projects are now on hold.

Have a great Autumn/Winter, and I'll see you on the other side.

*Addendum*: I really like the title of this post; inhabiting the liminal space
between the the plainspoken declaration "I'm on parental leave" and the more
philosophical/pretentious "On *blah...*" literary device.
