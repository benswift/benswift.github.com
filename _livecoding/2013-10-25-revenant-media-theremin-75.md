> To celebrate UNESCO’s World Day for Audio Visual Media the ANU School of Art
> presents an evening of Revenant Media, two important events bringing old media
> back to life in a new context. In Theremin ’75 a pioneering piece of
> Australian new media, Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski’s theremin of 1975, will be
> played again. ([ANU Media]({{ page.event_url }}))

To celebrate, I put together a theremin-inspired livecoding set (with live
visuals inspired by Stan's beautiful theremins).

This is a direct screencapture of my performance, so you don't get the crowd
(sadly). On the upside, the video & audio quality is much nicer.
