This was a really nice gig---the final gig of the day as part of the You Are
Here (YAH) festival program. The screen was projected onto a bedsheet hanging
from the wall, and I think some folks were even there in their pyjamas. As a
result, I went for a "downtempo glitch" vibe. Here are a couple of photos, no
videos have turned up (sadly).
