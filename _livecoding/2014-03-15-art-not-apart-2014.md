As per the [Art, Not Apart website]({{ page.event_url }})

> Livecoding: it’s programming as performance—beats from bits. See music and
> visuals made with code, right in front of your eyes. Everything you can see
> and hear is programmed live by Ben Swift and Torben Sko using their own custom
> software. No canned loops; only the freshest locally produced sustainable
> organic hipster vegan beats for your enjoyment.

This gig was my first livecoding collaboration with media artist [Torben
Sko](https://torbensko.com/).
