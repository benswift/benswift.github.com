A concert and gallery show organised to farewell to [John
Hosking](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/j-hosking), the Dean of the
ANU College of Engineering & Computer Science.

John was a great supporter of livecoding research[^code] at the ANU, and it was
fitting to be able to send him off in style.
