Here is the video of my set at the *Beginning Middle End* festival.
Unfortunately the audio's pretty bad---we didn't take a direct line out of the
desk.

This was an **interactive** live coding concert; there were some iPhones and
iPod Touches being passed around the audience running my own custom app which
could be used to influence certain aspects of the music.
