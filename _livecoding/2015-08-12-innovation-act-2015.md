[Innovation ACT](https://innovationact.org) (IACT) is Canberra's largest
entrepreneurship program. In 2015 I was invited to come and launch the event
with a livecoding set. Lots of fun to show the way that code & software are
breaking into all areas of life---including DJing.

This was a long set---around 90 mins---and there's no surviving video for the
full set. This excerpt video gives a flavour[^ap] of the gig, though.

[^ap]:
    observant viewers will notice that the synth line here is *quite* similar to
    the one I use in the [*aesthetic* visuals set during the AP
    Sessions]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _livecoding/2014-09-30-ap-sessions.md
    %}#aesthetic-visuals)---I figure that since the AP sessions were a bit of a
    hybrid gig/research thing (and because I quite liked how it turned out) I'd
    give it another outing in a gig with a "proper" audience
