  <p>The <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au">ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science</a>
(CECS) is being <em>Reimagined</em>. Don’t take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au">Elanor</a>:</p>

<section class="center" style="clear:both;">

  

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjlgEZzaL6k" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:50vw; height:50vh;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>

</section>

<p>Basically, this <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine">Reimagine project</a> is a
<em>huge</em> investment from the ANU for CECS to grow, change, and to skate to where
the puck is going to be in 2050 (technologically, societally, culturally, and
more).</p>

<p>The search is on within CECS to identify <strong>Reimagine Fellows</strong> to champion
various parts of this transformation. This is super-exciting, especially for
interdisciplinary art/design/technology folks (like me). It’d be exciting if it
was happening <em>anywhere</em>, but it’s particularly exciting that it’s happening
where I am and that I might get a voice in shaping exactly what a “reimagined
CECS” looks like.</p>

<p class="hl-para">Elanor, if you’re reading, I want to be a Reimagine Fellow (<a href="/blog/2019/08/30/Im-a-reimagine-fellow/">update 30 Aug 2019:
🙌🥳🙌</a>).
And since the
<a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest">EoI</a>
asked for “1000 words <strong>in any format you like</strong>”, here’s mine in the form of an
FAQ<sup id="fnref:faq"><a href="#fn:faq" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="bens-reimagine-fellow-application-faq">Ben’s <em>Reimagine Fellow</em> Application FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="in-one-sentence-why-do-you-want-to-be-a-reimagine-fellow">In one sentence, why do you want to be a Reimagine Fellow?</h3>

<p>I want to see more art<sup id="fnref:art"><a href="#fn:art" class="footnote">2</a></sup> happening in CECS; and I want to strengthen our
education and research ties to the Schools of Art &amp; Design, Music, and Digital
Humanities.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-have-to-do-with-the-reimagine-project">What does that have to do with the Reimagine Project?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The role of an artist is to ask questions, not to answer them</em> -<strong>Anton
Chekhov</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Elanor says in the video above, we don’t even know what tomorrow’s problems
are yet; so we need problem <em>finders</em>, not just problem <em>solvers</em>. Art and
artists have a key role to play in this (just ask Chekhov).</p>

<h3 id="why-are-you-the-best-person-to-do-this">Why are you the best person to do this?</h3>

<p>I’ve made a career (so far) of deploying my technical/CS skills to artistic
ends: in my livecoding (both building
<a href="https://github.com/digego/extempore">tools</a> and <a href="/livecoding/index.html">doing live
gigs</a>), in starting the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/">ANU Laptop
Ensemble</a>,
in teaching our first-year art+code course
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">COMP1720</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Along the way I’ve built strong networks in these areas across the ANU campus
and in the wider community, and I’ve always said that I was keen to engage with
them more deeply—this is my chance.</p>

<h3 id="so-youre-just-trying-to-score-a-grant-to-go-off-and-do-your-own-weird-art-thing">So you’re just trying to score a grant to go off and do your own weird art thing?</h3>

<p>Absolutely not. Being a Reimagine Fellow isn’t about doing something by
yourself—it’s way too big a project for that. It’s about weaving something
into the whole College<sup id="fnref:dna"><a href="#fn:dna" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, so that by 2050 it affects the way <em>everyone</em>
thinks.</p>

<h3 id="what-might-this-look-like-concretely">What might this look like, concretely?</h3>

<p>The Reimagine Project is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">big, hairy, and
audacious</a>, so it’s
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like.</p>

<h4 id="in-the-short-term">In the short term…</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a CECS-supported “Reimagine residency” (starting asap!) to support artists to
get involved and help us figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks like</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
where students take courses from within CECS, the <a href="http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au">ANU School of Art &amp;
Design</a>, and the <a href="https://music.anu.edu.au">ANU School of
Music</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new courses within CECS on e.g. algorithmic music composition, creative
making, AI/Deep Learning Art, subversive computing/<a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/21/designed-for-evil/">designing for
evil</a><sup id="fnref:genevieve"><a href="#fn:genevieve" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more PhD students doing practice-led research on interdisciplinary
art/CS/engineering projects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encouraging <strong>all</strong> CECS academics to engage with their peers and the wider
world by <em>making and exhibiting beautiful/interesting/challenging things</em>, not
just through journal papers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-the-mediumlong-term">In the medium/long term…</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the <a href="http://cass.anu.edu.au">College of Arts &amp; Social
Sciences</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a thoroughly non-traditional project-based “creative tech” masters program,
with no classes, no heirarchies, just a bunch of brilliant students set loose
with duct tape, gaming GPUs, a giant bag of sensors &amp; actuators, soldering
irons, a 3D printer, oh my. (Geoff Hinchcliffe and I have discussed
this—we’re both thrilled and terrified at the prospect. And I love what the
<a href="https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/#apply">3AI</a> master’s program is shaping
up to be, and am keen to be a part of it.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incorporating into every course<sup id="fnref:every-course"><a href="#fn:every-course" class="footnote">5</a></sup> the option to create and submit
a “creative work” to demonstrate attainment of the learning outcomes (🤔
really Ben?)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I also look forward to having the time to think through what a deeply artistic
CECS looks like. I’m sure that in collaboration with the other Reimagine Fellows
and the rest of the design team we can come up even more ideas.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-this-further-the-broader-goals-of-the-reimagine-project">How does this further the broader goals of the Reimagine Project…</h3>

<h4 id="in-research">…in research?</h4>

<p>Artists have always been at the vanguard of building new things (or seeing/using
old things in new ways). If an artist has an idea in their head for what they
want to create, but the tools to realise it don’t exist yet, that artist is
<em>intrinsically</em> motivated to figure out how to make it happen.</p>

<p>I also want to be clear that my pitch here isn’t to view the arts as a technical
problem that needs to be <em>solved</em> by engineers and computer scientists: “hey
artists, thanks for the last few thousand years, we’ll take it from here”. We’ve
already got too much technochauvinism in tech. Instead, the pitch is that a
newly-Reimagined CECS can <em>include</em> artists in shaping what the computer
scientists and engineers of 2050 look like, so that it’s <em>not</em> an “us and them”.</p>

<p>Some of the top research institutions in the world are asking real questions in
the fields of creative technology, digital art, music and design: have a look at
<a href="#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening">the list below</a>.</p>

<h4 id="in-education">…in education?</h4>

<p>That Chekhov quote above really nails it. For some students, being asked to make
something creative/artistic is what it takes to flick the switch to go beyond
the “what boxes do I need to tick for me to get a P/CR/D/HD” mindset to actually
asking the right questions. I see this sometimes in
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">COMP1720</a>, and it’s one of the most
enjoyable things about teaching that course.</p>

<p>More broadly, I want to see more dreamers, doodlers and “creatives”<sup id="fnref:creatives"><a href="#fn:creatives" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
study engineering or CS at uni. Too often they feel like they have to choose
between “pursuing the dream” or selling out and studying something boring &amp;
pragmatic, and I fear that we (CECS) miss out on some <em>brilliant</em> students
because of this. I want these students to know that they can pursue their
creative dreams, and in doing so they’ll be doing top-class
engineering/CS/design work.</p>

<h4 id="in-outreach">…in outreach?</h4>

<p>Because of my <a href="/livecoding/index.html">livecoding</a> I get
asked to do outreach stuff all the time (you’re welcome, CECS marketing team
😉). I know why I get asked: DJing with code is so <em>different</em>, it’s a great
hook for engaging folks who might not have thought that combining code &amp; musical
creativity in that way was possible.</p>

<h4 id="in-culture">…in culture?</h4>

<p>The Reimagine Project isn’t just about doing the same things under a different
org-chart. It’s about changing the culture of Engineering &amp; Computing research
and practice. While the stereotypes about nerdy engineers and computer types
isn’t necessarily fair in my experience, there’s no smoke without a fire, and
there <em>are</em> some things we need to do better. Incorporating the arts and
creative expression deep within our education, research and outreach work will
change the way we communicate with the outside world, but it’ll also change the
sorts of people we attract, and welcoming new perspectives into CECS is another
way we can enact cultural change.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-this-treading-on-the-toes-of-the-school-of-art--design-and-the-school-of-music-and-">Isn’t this treading on the toes of the School of Art &amp; Design (and the School of Music, and …)?</h3>

<p>No—in fact we need to work with our colleagues in those places to make this
stuff happen. I already co-supervise PhD students with
<a href="https://twitter.com/mtchl">Mitchell</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitron">Geoff</a>
from the School or Art &amp; Design, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tmtn">Terhi</a> from the
Centre for Digital Humanities Research, and I run the ANU Laptop Ensemble with
<a href="https://twitter.com/huntercomposer">Alec</a> from the School of Music. And I want
to see <em>more</em> of this type of cross-supervision across these parts of campus.</p>

<p>Actually, this “treading on toes” question looms over the whole Reimagine
Project. I think the best way forward is to partner with the other parts of
campus to bring their expertise and smoosh it together with ours.</p>

<p>Concretely, that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sending CECS coursework students to take courses in other parts of campus (as
part of majors/minors/electives, etc.) as well as the other way around</li>
  <li>co-employing academics across Colleges in joint positions</li>
  <li>increasing our to participation in the ANU’s interdisciplinary HDR programs
like <a href="http://rsha.cass.anu.edu.au/students/future/iccr">ICCR</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening">Where in the world is this already happening?</h3>

<p>Here’s a few places, including what each place says about their goals (from the
marketing copy on their own website). Many (but not all) of these labs/groups
are in CS/Engineering Schools, or at least in design schools.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Stanford <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu">Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics</a> (CCRMA) is a multi-disciplinary
facility where composers and researchers work together using computer-based
technology both as an artistic medium and as a research tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a> is an interdisciplinary
research lab that encourages the unconventional mixing and matching of
seemingly disparate research areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org">Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative
Inquiry</a> at Carnegie Mellon University is

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://gtcmt.gatech.edu">Center for Music Technology</a> at Georgia Tech
aims to transform the ways we create and experience music, and to create the
next generation of technology for composition, performance, consumption, and

<blockquote>
  <p>NYU’s <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">ITP</a> (Interactive Telecommunications
Program) is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the
Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative use of communications
technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory —
focusing especially on artistic intervention. It’s a hybrid of a school,
residency and research group.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="has-the-anu-ever-had-anything-like-this-before">Has the ANU ever had anything like this before?</h3>

<p>Sure, for example <a href="http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/">this</a>, and it was
amazing. The story about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I’ve only
really ever heard it second/third-hand, and I’m not proposing to resurrect ACAT
as part of the Reimagine Project. But it’s important to know one’s history.</p>

<h3 id="sounds-like-a-huge-job-benhow-are-you-going-to-manage-it">Sounds like a huge job, Ben—how are you going to manage it?</h3>

<p>Not on my own, that’s for sure. Only by building up our capacity in these areas.
As an example, <a href="https://twitter.com/cpmpercussion">Dr. Charles Martin</a> is just
about to start as a Lecturer in RSCS, and he’s a computer musician (apps and ML
for group musical improvisation). The campus also has many other
interdisciplinary artists who have been hiding their lights under bushels—I
want to give them a banner to rally to.</p>

<p>We need to think big, and I look forward to a day where there’s a long list of
academic staff &amp; PhD students exploring new avenues for technologically and
culturally sophisticated artistic practice within CECS and the broader ANU
campus. That’s what I want us to be famous for.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-really-get-asked-these-questions-frequently-ben">Do you really get asked these questions <em>frequently</em>, Ben?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-it-really-fair-to-call-it-an-faq">So is it really fair to call it an <em>F</em>AQ?</h3>

<p>Probably not. Sorry.</p>

      <p>Defining “art” is beyond the scope of this blog post, obviously. But I don’t
just mean it in the narrow “high/fine art” sense, although I don’t mean it
