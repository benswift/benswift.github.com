  <p>Is it possible to learn about algorithms by writing poetry about wealth
inequality? How about commenting on social media use via sculptures built using
cybersecurity tools and concepts? Furthermore, is it possible to design an
assessment task which encourages deep technical work and honest cultural
reflection in producing a genuinely interesting creative outcome?</p>

<p>This workshop will bring together folks from all points of the
code/creativity/culture compass to design a <em>real</em> assessment task for the c/c/c
studio creative code outreach program. In fact, it <em>needs</em> a diverse range of
voices to work properly. So if youâ€™ve got thoughts and ideas about
CS/Engineering curriculum design, the arts, and life within the socio-technical
assemblage of our present age, then come along and have your say!</p>

<p>This workshop is part of the <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/events/event-series/codesign-culture-lab">CoDesign Culture
Lab</a>â€”title
TBC. If youâ€™re coming to the culture lab and youâ€™d like to be part of the
workshop, <a href="mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au">get in touch</a> ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>Youâ€™re a curriculum designer for the c/c/c studio! Welcome aboard.</p>

<p><strong>Todayâ€™s task</strong>: in groups, come up with a assessment<sup id="fnref:assessment"><a href="#fn:assessment" class="footnote">1</a></sup> task which
explores a <em>problem</em> through a creative <em>process</em> using a particular <em>tool</em>.</p>

<p>At the end of this workshop, your group will produce (and present to the rest of
us) two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an assessment spec document: brief description &amp; motivation, learning
outcomes, any specific constraints or requirements on either the deliverable
or the process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a set of assessment criteria which will be used to assess the submissions for
your assessment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you donâ€™t get to pick the <em>problem</em>/<em>process</em>/<em>tool</em> triad which forms
the basis for your assessment task. Instead, weâ€™ll spin the
code/creativity/culture wheels and let fate[^fate].</p>

<p>[^fate] well, the PRNG in your web browser, anyway</p>

<h3 id="code">code</h3>

<p>The <em>tool</em> (or class of tools) which the students need to leverage in their
creative response. This is deliberately broadâ€”you can (and should) narrow it
down in <em>your</em> assessment task spec.</p>

<p>Note: one other way to frame this is this is the skill/concept that you want the
students to learn (perhaps surreptitiously) in <em>doing</em> the assessment task.</p>

<p>Now that youâ€™ve spun the wheel, youâ€™ve got a context in which to come up with a
specific assesssment task. You might be thinking that the c/c/c wheels left you
with a pretty broad scopeâ€”and youâ€™d be rightâ€”your groupâ€™s job is to narrow
this down into a specific task which is tractable for your intended audience of
students.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the target age/background/etc of the students is up to youâ€”you could choose
early high-school one-off workshop, year 11/12 extension program (i.e. the
c/c/c studio), first-year assignment at uni, graduate-level coursework, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in plain language, what do you want a student to learn through the process of
completing your assessment task? (that will help with coming up with some
learning outcomes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how might the <em>tool</em> and the <em>process</em> shape the responses to the problem? can
you use this to your advantage in encouraging students to attain the learning
outcomes?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how are you going to constrain the scope of your task so that it supports
students from a wide range of backgrounds/abilities?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="group-work-session-2">Group work session 2: articulating the assessment criteria</h2>

<h3 id="things-to-think-about-1">Things to think about</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what would an <em>excellent</em> submission look like? what would a
borderline-acceptable (e.g. a bare pass) submission look like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the problems (from the culture wheel) are <em>not solvable through a single
assessment task</em>, so donâ€™t make that the criteriaâ€”instead, you want students
to explore &amp; understand the problem, process &amp; tool more deeply</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="presenter-bio">Presenter bio</h3>

<p>Dr Ben Swift is a Senior Lecturer in the ANU Research School of Computer Science
(RSCS). As the leader of the code/creativity/culture (c/c/c) research group,
Benâ€™s goal is to create spaces for talking about the way that code (software),
creativity (especially the arts) and culture (life) intersect in the modern
world. Benâ€™s research contributions range from traditional Computer Science
(digital multimedia, web technologies and human-computer interaction) through to
invited livecoding (live code-based music performance) performances and
multimedia artwork installations.</p>

<p>In 2019 Ben was awarded one of the inaugural <em>Reimagine Fellowships</em> to develop
the <strong>c/c/c studio</strong>, an ANU Extension outreach program which will teach
computer science to pre-tertiary students through making art, music and other
cool things with computers. The c/c/c studio will also provide a supportive
community in which a new generation of people can learn, create, and
shareâ€”unlocking the latent potential in students who never knew their diverse
interests (especially in the arts &amp; music) could be used in engineering and
computing.</p>
