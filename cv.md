<!-- NOTE: this is largely copypasta'd from research.md---in future I should refactor it more nicely. -->

I am an internationally-recognised multidisciplinary
[**scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OQdYgLEAAAAJ) in the
Research School of Computer Science at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift)---Australia's top-ranked
University (#24 QS world ranking 2018/2019). I'm interested in computational art
& music, data visualisation, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. I'm the
director of the [code/creativity/culture
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) at the ANU Research
School of Computer Science.

I am a livecoding [**artist**]({% link livecoding.md %}), and have performed at
both local and international arts festivals, including the International
Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA) and the International Conference on Live
Coding (ICLC). You can find recordings of some of my sets [on my livecoding
page]({% link livecoding.md %}). I'm the vice president of the [Australasian
Computer Music Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA). I'm also one
of the inaugural [ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.

I am a [**maker**](https://github.com/benswift) of open-source software tools
for music, creative code, data analysis/visualisation, and more. I'm one half of
the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) programming environment <a
style="vertical-align: sub;"
href="https://github.com/digego/extempore/stargazers"><img style="width:unset;"
alt="GitHub stars"
src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/digego/extempore"></a>, the
state-of-the-art in livecoding languages. Extempore's users are a worldwide
community of programmers, artists, musicians, data visualisation practitioners
and other domain experts with differing backgrounds and levels of software
expertise. I have more than 10 years experience as an OSS community manager,
technical writer, software engineer and creative code outreach ambassador.

## Teaching

### Current courses

I am currently the course convenor & lecturer for the following two courses in
the [ANU Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) (follow links to the
curriculum, available under
[CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)):

- [COMP2710: Laptop Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/) is a
  course open to students in computer science, music, art, and elsewhere at ANU.
  In this course students learn fundamental skills of music computing,
  including digital synthesis, algorithmic composition, and musical
  interface design, putting these skills to use creating a computer
  musical instrument, composition, or interactive media work to
  present in concert at the end of the course.

- [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
  Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) is a course about learning to
  tell stories through interactive code art. It's not _just_ an art course, and
  it's not just a code course: students need to use both halves of their brains,
  and (I hope) have a lot of fun in the process. No previous coding or artistic
  experience is required: COMP1720 teaches everything from the ground up.

### Past courses {#past-courses}

I have also written and delivered the following courses:

- [COMP2300: Computer Organisation and Program
  Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) is ANU's introductory
  computer architecture course, which I wrote (with help from [Uwe
  Zimmer](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/zimmer-ur)) and delivered
  from 2017--2018, and is now being delivered by [Charles
  Martin](http://charlesmartin.com.au/). In this course students take a complex
  computer system ([the STM32L476G discovery "disco"
  board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l476gdiscovery.html)) home from
  week 1. That might seem daunting---and it's true that there's more stuff on
  such a board than one can master in one semester---but students can still
  learn a lot about CPUs (and how programs are organised and executed) by the
  end of the course.

- The [COMP2710 _Internet of Things_ China Study
  Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) is an in-country
  intensive study course conducted in partnership with the [Beijing Institute of
  Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). In this course students learn about
  low-cost, network-connected embedded computing devices & their relationship to
  the broader computing landscape through building a prototype IoT artefact (and
  releasing the source code, parts list and build instructions on GitHub), while
  reflecting on the design, security, social and ethical challenges associated
  with the Internet of Things.

## Service

- Since **2016** I have been the academic design lead on the CECS Teaching &
  Learning Web infrastructure project, which includes the CECS Jekyll Course
  Website template and GitLab infrastructure for teaching large courses.

- Since **2018** I have been the alternate CECS representative for the ANU-wide
  Technology-Enhanced Learning Reference Group (TELRG), which meets regularly to
  discuss and review issues relating to educational technology systems and
  technology-enhanced teaching and learning.
  
- Since **2018** I have been part of an ANU-wide committee (under Prof. Nick
  Brown) charged with creating a digital artifact/resource to commemorate the
  ANU's 75th anniversary in 2021.

- From **2015--2019** I was the RSCS Student Experience convenor (UG)---the
  first ever appointment to this role within RSCS. In this role I worked on
  improving the experience of our students, especially those who may fall
  through the cracks of the other support structures in place within the
  college.
